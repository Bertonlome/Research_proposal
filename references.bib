	abstract = {Proposals for air traffic management such as Free Flight call for a transfer of responsibility for separation between aircraft from air traffic controllers (ATCos) to pilots. Under many proposals, the role of the ATCo will change from one of active control to passive monitoring. The present study directly compared these types of control with respect to ATCo mental workload, conflict detection, and memory. Eighteen ATCos participated in an air traffic control simulation of Free Flight procedures under moderate and high traffic load. Dependent variables included accuracy and timeliness in detecting potential conflicts, accepting and handing off aircraft, mental workload (as assessed by a secondary task, heart rate variability, and subjective ratings), and memory for aircraft location. High traffic density and passive control both degraded conflict detection performance. Actual or potential applications of this research include the recommendation that designs for future air traffic management keep authority for separation of aircraft with the controller.},

	abstract = {A powerful way of improving one’s memory for material is to be tested on that material. Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surprising phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

	abstract = {The out-of-the-loop performance problem, a major potential consequence of automation, leaves operators of automated systems handicapped in their ability to take over manual operations in the event of automation failure. This is attributed to a possible loss of skills and of situation awareness (SA) arising from vigilance and complacency problems, a shift from active to passive information processing, and change in feedback provided to the operator. We studied the automation of a navigation task using an expert system and demonstrated that low SA corresponded with out-of-the-loop performance decrements in decision time following a failure of the expert system. Level of operator control in interacting with automation is a major factor in moderating this loss of SA. Results indicated that the shift from active to passive processing was most likely responsible for decreased SA under automated conditions.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide an overview of concepts of operation for single pilot operations (SPO) and a synthesis of recently published work evaluating these concepts.
Background: Advances in technology have made it possible for a commercial aircraft to be flown by a single pilot under normal conditions, and research is being conducted to examine the feasibility of implementing SPO for commercial aviation.
Method: Context leading up to the consideration of SPO for commercial flight is provided, including the benefits and challenges. Recent studies examining issues relating to automation, operations, and communications in the SPO context are presented.
Results: A number of concepts have been proposed and tested for SPO, and no one concept has been shown to be superior. Single pilots were able to successfully resolve off-nominal scenarios with either the groundsupport or cockpit-automation tools examined. However, the technologies developed in support of these concepts are in prototype forms and need further development.
Conclusion: There have been no obvious “show stoppers” for moving toward SPO. However, the current state of research is in its initial stages, and more research is needed to examine other challenges associated with SPO. Moreover, human factors researchers must continue to be involved in the development of the new tools and technologies to support SPO to ensure their effectiveness. Application: The research issues highlighted in the context of SPO reflect issues that are associated with the process of reducing crew members or providing remote support of operators and, more generally, human interactions with increasingly autonomous systems.},

Following a major investigation, it was concluded that the incident resulted from a series of events that began when the autopilot disconnected after the aircraft’s Pitot tubes froze in an adverse weather system. The ﬁndings place scrutiny on the aircrew’s subsequent lack of awareness of what was going on and of what procedure was required, and their failure to control the aircraft. This article argues that this is inappropriate, instead offering a systems level view that can be used to demonstrate how systems, not individuals, lose situation awareness. This is demonstrated via a distributed situation awareness-based description of the events preceding the crash. The ﬁndings demonstrate that it was the sociotechnical system comprising aircrew, cockpit and aeroplane systems that lost situation awareness, rather than the aircrew alone.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examined the impact of stage of automation on the performance and perceived workload during simulated robotic arm control tasks in routine and off-nominal scenarios.
Background: Automation varies with respect to the stage of information processing it supports and its assigned level of automation. Making appropriate choices in terms of stages and levels of automation is critical to ensure robust joint system performance. To date, this issue has been empirically studied in domains such as aviation and medicine but not extensively in the context of space operations.
Method: A total of 36 participants played the role of a payload specialist and controlled a simulated robotic arm. Participants performed fly-to tasks with two types of automation (camera recommendation and trajectory control automation) of varying stage. Tasks were performed during routine scenarios and in scenarios in which either the trajectory control automation or a hazard avoidance automation failed.
Results: Increasing the stage of automation progressively improved performance and lowered workload when the automation was reliable, but incurred severe performance costs when the system failed.
Conclusion: The results from this study support concerns about automation-induced complacency and automation bias when later stages of automation are introduced. The benefits of such automation are offset by the risk of catastrophic outcomes when system failures go unnoticed or become difficult to recover from.},

	abstract = {Objective: The feasibility of measuring drivers’ automation trust via gaze behavior during highly automated driving was assessed with eye tracking and validated with self-reported automation trust in a driving simulator study.
Background: Earlier research from other domains indicates that drivers’ automation trust might be inferred from gaze behavior, such as monitoring frequency.
Method: The gaze behavior and self-reported automation trust of 35 participants attending to a visually demanding non-driving-related task (NDRT) during highly automated driving was evaluated. The relationship between dispositional, situational, and learned automation trust with gaze behavior was compared.
Results: Overall, there was a consistent relationship between drivers’ automation trust and gaze behavior. Participants reporting higher automation trust tended to monitor the automation less frequently. Further analyses revealed that higher automation trust was associated with lower monitoring frequency of the automation during NDRTs, and an increase in trust over the experimental session was connected with a decrease in monitoring frequency.
Conclusion: We suggest that (a) the current results indicate a negative relationship between drivers’ self-reported automation trust and monitoring frequency, (b) gaze behavior provides a more direct measure of automation trust than other behavioral measures, and (c) with further refinement, drivers’ automation trust during highly automated driving might be inferred from gaze behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses theoretical, empirical, and analytical studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of automation technology. Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to over reliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use.},

Amongst this burgeoning wave of untrammelled automation there is now beginning to arise a cadre of ever-more independent, autonomous systems. The degree of interaction between these latter systems with any form of human controller is becoming progressively more diminished and remote; and this perhaps necessarily so. Here, I advocate for human-centred and human favouring constraints to be designed, programmed, promulgated and imposed upon these nascent forms of independent entity. I am not sanguine about the collective response of modern society to this call. Nevertheless, the warning must be voiced and the issue debated, especially among those who most look to mediate between people and technology.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated how automationinduced human performance consequences depended on the degree of automation (DOA).
Background: Function allocation between human and automation can be represented in terms of the stages and levels taxonomy proposed by Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens. Higher DOAs are achieved both by later stages and higher levels within stages.
Method: A meta-analysis based on data of 18 experiments examines the mediating effects of DOA on routine system performance, performance when the automation fails, workload, and situation awareness (SA). The effects of DOA on these measures are summarized by level of statistical significance.
Results: We found (a) a clear automation benefit for routine system performance with increasing DOA, (b) a similar but weaker pattern for workload when automation functioned properly, and (c) a negative impact of higher DOA on failure system performance and SA. Most interesting was the finding that negative consequences of automation seem to be most likely when DOA moved across a critical boundary, which was identified between automation supporting information analysis and automation supporting action selection.
Conclusion: Results support the proposed cost–benefit trade-off with regard to DOA. It seems that routine performance and workload on one hand, and the potential loss of SA and manual skills on the other hand, directly trade off and that appropriate function allocation can serve only one of the two aspects.},

	abstract = {Objective:  The study addresses the impact of time pressure on human interactions with automated decision support systems (DSSs) and related performance consequences.
Background:  When humans interact with DSSs, this often results in worse performance than could be expected from the automation alone. Previous research has suggested that time pressure might make a difference by leading humans to rely more on a DSS.
Method:  In two laboratory experiments, participants performed a luggage screening task either manually, supported by a highly reliable DSS, or by a low reliable DSS. Time provided for inspecting the X-r­ ays was 4.5 s versus 9 s varied within-­ subjects as the time pressure manipulation. Participants in the automation conditions were either shown the automation’s advice prior (Experiment 1) or following (Experiment 2) their own inspection, before they made their final decision.
Results:  In Experiment 1, time pressure compromised performance independent of whether the task was performed manually or with automation support. In Experiment 2, the negative impact of time pressure was only found in the manual but not in the two automation conditions. However, neither experiment revealed any positive impact of time pressure on overall performance, and the joint performance of human and automation was mostly worse than the performance of the automation alone.
Conclusion:  Time pressure compromises the quality of decision-­making. Providing a DSS can reduce this effect, but only if the automation’s advice follows the assessment of the human. Application:  The study provides suggestions for the effective implementation of DSSs in addition to supporting concerns that highly reliable DSSs are not used optimally by human operators.},

	abstract = {As autonomous and semiautonomous systems are developed for automotive, aviation, cyber, robotics and other applications, the ability of human operators to effectively oversee and interact with them when needed poses a significant challenge. An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human–autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human–automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human–autonomy interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed.},

	abstract = {Two experiments are reported that investigate to what extent performance consequences of automated aids are dependent on the distribution of functions between human and automation and on the experience an operator has with an aid. In the first experiment, performance consequences of three automated aids for the support of a supervisory control task were compared. Aids differed in degree of automation (DOA). Compared with a manual control condition, primary and secondary task performance improved and subjective workload decreased with automation support, with effects dependent on DOA. Performance costs include return-to-manual performance issues that emerged for the most highly automated aid and effects of complacency and automation bias, respectively, which emerged independent of DOA. The second experiment specifically addresses how automation bias develops over time and how this development is affected by prior experience with the system. Results show that automation failures entail stronger effects than positive experience (reliably working aid). Furthermore, results suggest that commission errors in interaction with automated aids can depend on three sorts of automation bias effects: (a) withdrawal of attention in terms of incomplete cross-checking of information, (b) active discounting of contradictory system information, and (c) inattentive processing of contradictory information analog to a “looking-but-not-seeing” effect.},

Because fully automated systems leave operators out of the decision-making loop (e.g., Billings, 1991), it is important to determine the right level and type of automation that will keep air traffic controllers in the loop. This study examined the differences in the situation awareness (SA) and collision detection performance of individuals when they worked with information acquisition, information analysis, decision and action selection and action implementation automation to control air traffic (Parasuraman, Sheridan, \& Wickens, 2000). When the automation was unreliable, the time taken to detect an upcoming collision was significantly longer for all the automation types compared with the information acquisition automation. This poor performance following automation failure was mediated by SA, with lower SA yielding poor performance. Thus, the costs associated with automation failure are greater when automation is applied to higher order stages of information processing. Results have practical implications for automation design and development of SA training programs.},

	abstract = {In this article we review and assess human-centered level of automation (LOA), an alternate approach to traditional, technology-centered design of automation in dynamic-control systems. The objective of human-controlled LOA is to improve human-machine performance by taking into account both operator and technological capabilities. Automation literature has shown that traditional automation can lead to problems in operator situation awareness (SA) due to the out-of-the (control) loop performance problem, which may lead to a negative impact on overall systems performance. Herein we address a standing paucity of research into LOA to deal with these problems. Various schemes of generic control system function allocations were developed to establish a LOA taxonomy. The functions allocated to a human operator, a computer, or both, included monitoring system variables, generating process plans, selecting an “optimal” plan and implementing the plan. Five different function allocation schemes, or LOAs, were empirically investigated as to their usefulness for enhancing telerobot system performance and operator SA, as well as reducing workload. Human participants participated in experimental trials involving a high fidelity, interactive simulation of a telerobot performing nuclear materials handling at the various LOAs. Automation failures were attributed to various simulated system deficiencies necessitating operator detection and correction to return to functioning at an automated mode. Operator performance at each LOA, and during the failure periods, was evaluated. Operator SA was measured using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique, and perceived workload was measured using the NASA-Task Load Index. Results demonstrated improvements in human-machine system performance at higher LOAs (levels involving greater computer control of system functions) along with lower operator subjective workload. However, under the same conditions, operator SA was reduced for certain types of system problems and reaction time to, and performance during, automation failures was substantially lower. Performance during automation failure was best when participants had been functioning at lower, intermediate LOAs (levels involving greater human control of system functions). © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: Our aim was to review empirical studies of complacency and bias in human interaction with automated and decision support systems and provide an integrated theoretical model for their explanation.
            Background: Automation-related complacency and automation bias have typically been considered separately and independently.
            Methods: Studies on complacency and automation bias were analyzed with respect to the cognitive processes involved.
            Results: Automation complacency occurs under conditions of multiple-task load, when manual tasks compete with the automated task for the operator’s attention. Automation complacency is found in both naive and expert participants and cannot be overcome with simple practice. Automation bias results in making both omission and commission errors when decision aids are imperfect.Automation bias occurs in both naive and expert participants, cannot be prevented by training or instructions, and can affect decision making in individuals as well as in teams.While automation bias has been conceived of as a special case of decision bias, our analysis suggests that it also depends on attentional processes similar to those involved in automation-related complacency.
            Conclusion: Complacency and automation bias represent different manifestations of overlapping automation-induced phenomena, with attention playing a central role. An integrated model of complacency and automation bias shows that they result from the dynamic interaction of personal, situational, and automation-related characteristics.
            Application: The integrated model and attentional synthesis provides a heuristic framework for further research on complacency and automation bias and design options for mitigating such effects in automated and decision support systems.},

Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

Background: Trust is increasingly important in the growing need for synergistic human–machine teaming. Thus, we expand on our previous meta-analytic foundation in the field of human–robot interaction to include all of automation interaction.
Method: We used meta-analysis to assess trust in automation. Thirty studies provided 164 pairwise effect sizes, and 16 studies provided 63 correlational effect sizes.
Results: The overall effect size of all factors on trust development was g¯    = +0.48, and the correlational effect was r¯   = +0.34, each of which represented medium effects. Moderator effects were observed for the human-related (g¯  = +0.49; r¯ = +0.16) and automationrelated (g¯  = +0.53; r¯  = +0.41) factors. Moderator effects specific to environmental factors proved insufficient in number to calculate at this time.
Conclusion: Findings provide a quantitative representation of factors influencing the development of trust in automation as well as identify additional areas of needed empirical research.},

The skill development group spent an equal amount of time using the flight simulator as a tool to develop instrument skills. Three performance variables (distance, altitude, and airspeed) were compared between the pretest and three posttests. For decisions involving distance, both training methods were effective.

Study 1 also revealed that identifying an AI as a tool instead of a teammate can have small benefits to human perceptions of job security and adoption. Study 2 revealed that the negative impacts of increasing responsibility can be mitigated by presenting AI teammates’ capabilities as being endorsed by coworkers and one’s own past experience.

	abstract = {Mental models are knowledge structures employed by humans to describe, explain, and predict the world around them. Shared Mental Models (SMMs) occur in teams whose members have similar mental models of their task and of the team itself. Research on human teaming has linked SMM quality to improved team performance. Applied understanding of SMMs should lead to improvements in human-AI teaming. Yet, it remains unclear how the SMM construct may differ in teams of human and AI agents, how and under what conditions such SMMs form, and how they should be quantified. This paper presents a review of SMMs and the associated literature, including their definition, measurement, and relation to other concepts. A synthesized conceptual model is proposed for the application of SMM literature to the human-AI setting. Several areas of AI research are identified and reviewed that are highly relevant to SMMs in human-AI teaming but which have not been discussed via a common vernacular. A summary of design considerations to support future experiments regarding Human-AI SMMs is presented. We find that while current research has made significant progress, a lack of consistency in terms and of effective means for measuring Human-AI SMMs currently impedes realization of the concept.},

This report contains a description of the helicopter mission, a list of assumptions bounding the task analysis, a description of the task analysis, and a comparison of workload at each stage of the mission. Emergency conditions and off-nominal operations were not considered in this analysis. The data revealed that in many cases (e.g. in normal operations with the assumed autonomous capability), despite the addition of new tasks for the aircraft captain, the autonomous system reduced overall crew workload by replacing the flying pilot with an autonomous system.},

	abstract = {Function Allocation methods are important for the appropriate allocation of tasks between humans and automated systems. It is proposed that Operational Event Sequence Diagrams (OESDs) provide a simple yet rigorous basis upon which allocation of work can be assessed. This is illustrated with respect to a design concept for a passenger aircraft flown by just a single pilot where the objective is to replace or supplement functions normally undertaken by the second pilot with advanced automation. A scenario-based analysis (take off) was used in which there would normally be considerable demands and interactions with the second pilot. The OESD analyses indicate those tasks that would be suitable for allocation to automated assistance on the flight deck and those tasks that are now redundant in this new configuration (something that other formal Function Allocation approaches cannot identify). Furthermore, OESDs are demonstrated to be an easy to apply and flexible approach to the allocation of function in prospective systems.Practitioner Summary: OESDs provide a simple yet rigorous basis upon which allocation of work can be assessed. The technique can deal with the flexible, dynamic allocation of work and the deletion of functions no longer required. This is illustrated using a novel design concept for a single-crew commercial aircraft.},

	abstract = {The current day flight deck operational environment consists of a two-person Captain/First Officer crew. A concept of operations (ConOps) to reduce the commercial cockpit to a single pilot from the current two pilot crew is termed Single Pilot Operations (SPO). This concept has been under study by researchers in the Flight Deck Display Research Laboratory (FDDRL) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ames (Johnson, Comerford, Lachter, Battiste, Feary, and Mogford, 2012) and researchers from Langley Research Centers (Schutte et al., 2007). Transitioning from a two pilot crew to a single pilot crew will undoubtedly require changes in operational procedures, crew coordination, use of automation, and in how the roles and responsibilities of the flight deck and ATC are conceptualized in order to maintain the high levels of safety expected of the US National Airspace System. These modifications will affect the roles and the subsequent tasks that are required of the various operators in the NextGen environment. The current report outlines the process taken to identify and document the tasks required by the crew according to a number of operational scenarios studied by the FDDRL between the years 2012-2014. A baseline task decomposition has been refined to represent the tasks consistent with a new set of entities, tasks, roles, and responsibilities being explored by the FDDRL as the move is made towards SPO. Information from Subject Matter Expert interviews, participation in FDDRL experimental design meetings, and study observation was used to populate and refine task sets that were developed as part of the SPO task analyses. The task analysis is based upon the proposed ConOps for the third FDDRL SPO study. This experiment possessed nine different entities operating in six scenarios using a variety of SPO-related automation and procedural activities required to guide safe and efficient aircraft operations. The task analysis presents the roles and responsibilities in a manner that can facilitate testing future scenarios. Measures of task count and workload were defined and analyzed to assess the impact of transitioning to a SPO environment.},

	abstract = {Global air transport demand is increasing steadily, with the global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) growing at an annual rate of 4\% [1] and the number of passengers rising at an average annual rate of 10.6\% [2]. By the end of 2016, it is estimated that 1,420 large commercial airliners will be produced, 40.5\% more than was produced five years ago [2]. A consequence of this growth is an exacerbation of the existing global shortage of qualified pilots. Airlines have to hire more than 500,000 new commercial pilots until 2034 in order to meet this unprecedented air transport demand [3]. Additionally, the high costs associated with training and remuneration of pilots has been a substantial economic burden on air carriers, prompting active research into the concept of single-pilot operations (SPO) as an option for the future evolution of commercial airliners. SPO cockpits have already been developed for military fighters as well as general aviation (GA) aircraft, with small business jets like the Cessna Citation I obtaining approval for SPO as early as 1977 [4], however, the last decade has seen considerable interest in the implementation of SPO in commercial aviation. NASA has been conducting SPO-related studies since the mid-2000s [5], [6], while some recent research in Europe has focused on the technical [7] and operational [8] challenges of SPO. In the SPO concept of operations (Figure 1), a single pilot operates the flight deck with increased ground support from a dedicated ground human flight crew. The ground operators (GO) fulfil a role similar to that of a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) operator, providing a combination of strategic and tactical support to the single pilot in collaboration with the air traffic controllers (ATCo).},

To explore in advance the problems that the introduction of SPO into the aviation system would bring, the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach has been widely used in the development of SPO. A systematic review of the progress of HCD approach in SPO research can promote further development of SPO. In this paper, the literature resources of SPO were firstly retrieved from scientific research databases by subject search and were used as the input of scientometric analysis to obtain the highly cited literature, the number of annual publications, and the co-authorship network, which enables readers to understand the research trends and research groups of current SPO. Secondly, the development, application, and research process of the HCD approach were introduced in detail, and the progress of the HCD approach in SPO research was reviewed systematically from three aspects: concept design, function allocation, and system evaluation. Finally, limitations of current SPO research and future research directions for applying the HCD approach to SPO were also discussed.},

Automated systems are not always reliable, and when automation errs, humans must engage in error management, which is the process of detecting, understanding, and correcting errors. However, this process of error management in the context of human-automation interaction is not well understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the variables that contribute to error management. We examined relevant research in human-automation interaction and human error to identify critical automation, person, task, and emergent variables. We propose a framework for management of automation errors to incorporate and build upon previous models. Further, our analysis highlights variables that may be addressed through design and training to positively influence error management. Additional efforts to understand the error management process will contribute to automation designed and implemented to support safe and effective system performance.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present article undertakes a systematic review of the current state of science for Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) and Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation.Background: SPO/RCO have been investigated with different methods from various disciplines and different organizations to make research progress. The results of federal agencies’, universities’, and EU-projects’ research activities have not been brought together for synthesis yet.Method: We systematically searched for SPO and RCO as independent and fixed search terms retrieving altogether 75 publications on the topic. Exclusion criteria were general and military aviation.Results: Establishing an appropriate function allocation to cope with high workload and off-nominal situations could be achieved by applying a variety of methods and the consideration of advanced automation systems. Their application is required to investigate pilot incapacitation and communication issues further. Data-link and certification issues were acknowledged in principle and have not been solved yet.Conclusion: In sum, experimental studies and modeling techniques of system ergonomics have addressed operational issues very well. Pilot health monitoring systems are less well elaborated than system protection. Future research needs to integrate different research findings and automation technologies. This is necessary to make RCO to a viable and attractive option for commercial development in aviation.Abbreviations: ACFP: Autonomous Constrained Flight Planner; AOC: Airline Operations Center; ATC: Air Traffic Control; BP: Blood Pressure; CNPC: Control and Non-Payload Communication; ConOps: Concept of Operations; CMS: Crew Monitoring System; CRM: Crew Resource Management; CWA: Cognitive Work Analysis; EACS: Emergency Aircraft Control System; EAS: Emergency Avoidance System; EAST: Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork; ECG: Electrocardiogram; EDA: Electrodermal Activity; EEG: Electroencephalogram; EMG: Electromyogram; EOG: Electrooculogram; ESP: Electronic Stand-by-Pilot; FMS: Flight Management System; fNRIS: functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy; FRF: Flight Reconfiguration Function; GS: Ground Station; HAT: Human-Autonomy Teaming; HR: Heart Rate; HTA: Hierarchical Task Analysis; IATA: International Air Transport Association; MCO: Multi-Crew Operations; NASA-TLX: NASA Task Load Index; OESD: Operational Event Sequence Diagrams; OTDS: On-board Threat Detection System; PF: Pilot Flying; PKI: Public Key Infrastructure; PM: Pilot Monitoring; RCO: Reduced-Crew Operations; RR: Respiratory Rate; SA: Situation Awareness; SART: Situation Awareness Rating Technique; SME: Subject Matter Expert; SNA: Social Network Analysis; SPO: Single-Pilot Operations; SRM: Single-Pilot Resource Management; STAMP: System-Theoretic Accident Modeling and Process; STPA: System-Theoretic Process Analysis; SVM: Support Vector Machine; TARMS: Threat Assessment and Response Management System; UAV: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles; VLJ: Very Light Jets; WDA: Work Domain Analysis},

Eighteen two-pilot crews flew six scenarios under three conditions; one condition involved current-day operations while two involved RCO. In RCO flights, the Captain initially operated the simulated aircraft alone but could request remote crewmember support as off-nominal events occurred and workload was expected to increase. In one of the two RCO conditions, crewmembers were provided with advanced prototype collaboration tools designed to alleviate difficulties in crew coordination. Crews successfully solved all challenging events without accident and analyses of operational performance did not reveal any differences among the three conditions. In RCO flights, crew communication increased when tools were available relative to flights in which they were not; specifically, there were more acknowledgements and decision-making communications. These results suggest the collaboration tools enable higher degrees of crewmember awareness and/or coordination during distributed operations.},

Two technological approaches for the development of single-pilot airliners are being developed either based upon extant technology and operating concepts derived from uninhabited aviation systems and military aircraft, or alternatively based upon high levels of onboard autonomy/automation. This review considers the economic, technological, regulatory (safety) and societal acceptance of the single-pilot airliner, and examines some of the operational challenges that airlines may face. It is suggested that while the technological and safety challenges may be resolved, it is the operational challenges that may determine if the concept is ultimately viable.},

	doi = {10.1109/DASC.2016.7777998},
	abstract = {We performed a human-in-the-loop study to explore the role of transparency in engendering trust and reliance within highly automated systems. Specifically, we examined how transparency impacts trust in and reliance upon the Autonomous Constrained Flight Planner (ACFP), a critical automated system being developed as part of NASA's Reduced Crew Operations (RCO) Concept. The ACFP is designed to provide an enhanced ground operator, termed a super dispatcher, with recommended diversions for aircraft when their primary destinations are unavailable. In the current study, 12 commercial transport rated pilots who played the role of super dispatchers were given six time-pressured “all land” scenarios where they needed to use the ACFP to determine diversions for multiple aircraft. Two factors were manipulated. The primary factor was level of transparency. In low transparency scenarios the pilots were given a recommended airport and runway, plus basic information about the weather conditions, the aircraft types, and the airport and runway characteristics at that and other airports. In moderate transparency scenarios the pilots were also given a risk evaluation for the recommended airport, and for the other airports if they requested it. In the high transparency scenario additional information including the reasoning for the risk evaluations was made available to the pilots. The secondary factor was level of risk, either high or low. For high-risk aircraft, all potential diversions were rated as highly risky, with the ACFP giving the best option for a bad situation. For low-risk aircraft the ACFP found only low-risk options for the pilot. Both subjective and objective measures were collected, including rated trust, whether the pilots checked the validity of the automation recommendation, and whether the pilots eventually flew to the recommended diversion airport. Key results show that: 1) Pilots' trust increased with higher levels of transparency, 2) Pilots were more likely to verify ACFP's recommendations with low levels of transparency and when risk was high, 3) Pilots were more likely to explore other options from the ACFP in low transparency conditions and when risk was high, and 4) Pilots' decision to accept or reject ACFP's recommendations increased as a function of the transparency in the explanation. The finding that higher levels of transparency was coupled with higher levels of trust, a lower need to verify other options, and higher levels of agreement with ACFP recommendations, confirms the importance of transparency in aiding reliance on automated recommendations. Additional analyses of qualitative data gathered from subjects through surveys and during debriefing interviews also provided the basis for new design recommendations for the ACFP.},

	abstract = {New technology is flexible in the sense that it provides practitioners with a large number of functions and options for carrying out a given task under different circumstances. However, this flexibility has a price. Because the human supervisor must select the mode best suited to a particular situation, he or she must know more than before about system operations and the operation of the system as well as satisfy new monitoring and attentional demands to track which mode the automation is in and what it is doing to manage the underlying processes. When designers proliferate modes without supporting these new cognitive demands, new mode-related error forms and failure paths can result. Mode error has been discussed in human-computer interaction for some time; however, the increased capabilities and the high level of autonomy of new automated systems appear to have created new types of mode-related problems. We explore these new aspects based on results from our own and related studies of human-automation interaction. In particular, we draw on empirical data from a series of studies of pilot-automation interaction in commercial glass cockpit aircraft to illustrate the nature, circumstances, and potential consequences of mode awareness problems in supervisory control of automated resources. The result is an expanded view of mode error that takes into account the new demands imposed by more automated systems.},

Thirty studies provided 164 pairwise effect sizes, and 16 studies provided 63 correlational effect sizes. Results: The overall effect size of all factors on trust development was ḡ = +0.48, and the correlational effect was r ¯  = +0.34, each of which represented medium effects. Moderator effects were observed for the human-related (ḡ  = +0.49; r ¯ = +0.16) and automation-related (ḡ = +0.53; r ¯ = +0.41) factors. Moderator effects specific to environmental factors proved insufficient in number to calculate at this time.

	abstract = {Objective: We evaluate and quantify the effects of human, robot, and environmental factors on perceived trust in human-robot interaction (HRI). Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r̄ = +0.26, with an experimental effect size of d̄ = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors. Application: The findings provide quantitative estimates of human, robot, and environmental factors influencing HRI trust. Specifically, the current summary provides effect size estimates that are useful in establishing design and training guidelines with reference to robot-related factors of HRI trust. Furthermore, results indicate that improper trust calibration may be mitigated by the manipulation of robot design. However, many future research needs are identified.},

	abstract = {Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.},

	abstract = {This work examines how we may be able to anticipate, respond to, and train for the occurrence of rare, uncertain, and unexpected events in human-machine systems operations. In particular, it uses a foundational matrix which describes the combinations of the state-of-the-world and the state-of-the-respondent, to formulate preferred response strategies, contingent upon what is knowable and actionable in each circumstance. It employs the dichotomy of System I and System II forms of cognitive response and augments these perspectives with a further form of decision-making, namely Systems III. The latter is predicated upon reactions to novel, unprecedented, and even ‘unthinkable’ events. The degree to which any human operator, the associated automation and/or the autonomy of a system, or each of these acting in concert, can best deal with these ‘blue swan’ events is explored. Potential forms of remediation, especially featuring training, are discussed, and evaluated in light of the skills needed to respond to even prohibitive degrees of situational uncertainty.Practitioners summary: Practitioners are liable to witness a growing spectrum of unusual and, on occasion, even unprecedented events in the operation of systems for which they are responsible. They will be required to account for their response to these circumstances to a spectrum of involved constituencies to whom they answer. This work aids them in succeeding to bring clarity to such difficult and challenging processes.Abbreviations: K: Known; Unk: Unknown; AI: Artificial Intelligence; ML: Machine Learning; CHARM: Cockpit Human-Automation Resource Management; SDT: signal detection theory; ASRS: Aviation Safety Reporting System.},

	abstract = {Our long accepted and historically-persistent human narrative almost exclusively places us at the motivational centre of events. The wellspring of this anthropocentric fable arises from the unitary and bounded nature of personal consciousness. Such immediate conscious experience frames the heroic vision we have told to, and subsequently sold to ourselves. But need this centrality necessarily be a given? The following work challenges this, oft unquestioned, foundational assumption, especially in light of developments in automated, autonomous, and artificially-intelligent systems. For, in these latter technologies, human contributions are becoming ever more peripheral and arguably unnecessary. The removal of the human operator from the inner loops of momentary control has progressed to now an ever more remote function as some form of supervisory monitor. The natural progression of that line of evolution is the eventual excision of humans from access to any form of control loop at all. This may even include system maintenance and then, prospectively, even initial design. The present argument features a ‘unit of analysis’ provocation which explores the proposition that socially, and even ergonomically, the human individual no longer occupies priority or any degree of pre-eminent centrality. Rather, we are witnessing a transitional phase of development in which socio-technical collectives are evolving as the principle sources of what, may well be profoundly unhuman motivation. These developing proclivities occupy our landscape of technological innovations that daily act to magnify, rather than diminish, such progressive inhumanities. Where this leaves a science focused on work as a human-centred enterprise serves to occupy the culminating consideration of the present discourse.},

We illustrate here how overly narrow or broad definitions of automation failure limit the explanatory power of human performance models in a way that is not obviously reasoned. We then review three aviation safety events that challenge the overly narrow definition. Reflecting on those events and other observations, we propose an initial taxonomy of automation failure and other automation-related human performance challenges.

To fill this void, we introduce “Situation Awareness” (SA) as a conceptual framework for considering human-AI interaction (HAII). We argue that SA is an appropriate and valuable theoretical lens through which to decompose and view HAII as hierarchical layers that allow for closer inquiry and discovery. Furthermore, we illustrate why the SA perspective is particularly relevant to the current need to understand HCAI by identifying three tensions inherent in AI design and explaining how an SA-oriented approach may help alleviate these tensions. We posit that users’ enactment of SA will mitigate some negative impacts of AI systems on user experience, improve human agency during AI system use, and promote more efficient and effective in-situ decision-making.},

The explainable AI (XAI) literature aims to enhance human understanding and human-AI team performance by providing users with necessary information about AI system behavior. Simultaneously, the human factors literature has long addressed important considerations that contribute to human performance, including how to determine human informational needs, human workload, and human trust in autonomous systems. Drawing from the human factors literature, we propose the Situation Awareness Framework for Explainable AI (SAFE-AI), a three-level framework for the development and evaluation of explanations about AI system behavior. Our proposed levels of XAI are based on the informational needs of human users, which can be determined using the levels of situation awareness (SA) framework from the human factors literature. Based on our levels of XAI framework, we also suggest a method for assessing the effectiveness of XAI systems. We further detail human workload considerations for determining the content and frequency of explanations as well as metrics that can be used to assess human workload. Finally, we discuss the importance of appropriately calibrating user trust in AI systems through explanations along with other trust-related considerations for XAI, and we detail metrics that can be used to evaluate user trust in these systems.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of practice and training on fine-motor flying skills during a manual instrument landing system (ILS) approach.
            
            
              Background:
              There is an ongoing debate that manual flying skills of long-haul crews suffer from a lack of flight practice due to conducting only a few flights per month and the intensive use of automation. However, objective evidence is rare.
            
            
              Method:
              One hundred twenty-six randomly selected airline pilots had to perform a manual flight scenario with a raw data precision approach. Pilots were assigned to four equal groups according to their level of practice and training by fleet (short-haul, long-haul) and rank (first officer, captain).
            
            
              Results:
              Average ILS deviation scores differed significantly in relation to the group assignments. The strongest predictor variable was fleet, indicating degraded performance among long-haul pilots.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Manual flying skills are subject to erosion due to a lack of practice on long-haul fleets: All results support the conclusion that recent flight practice is a significantly stronger predictor for fine-motor flying performance than the time period since flight school or even the total or type-specific flight experience.
            
            
              Application:
              Long-haul crews have to be supported in a timely manner by adequate training tailored to address manual skills or by operational provisions like mixed-fleet flying or more frequent transitions between short-haul and long-haul operation.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              The aim of this study was to understand how the prolonged use of cockpit automation is affecting pilots’ manual flying skills.
            
            
              Background:
              There is an ongoing concern about a potential deterioration of manual flying skills among pilots who assume a supervisory role while cockpit automation systems carry out tasks that were once performed by human pilots.
            
            
              Method:
              We asked 16 airline pilots to fly routine and nonroutine flight scenarios in a Boeing 747-400 simulator while we systematically varied the level of automation that they used, graded their performance, and probed them about what they were thinking about as they flew.
            
            
              Results:
              We found pilots’ instrument scanning and manual control skills to be mostly intact, even when pilots reported that they were infrequently practiced. However, when pilots were asked to manually perform the cognitive tasks needed for manual flight (e.g., tracking the aircraft’s position without the use of a map display, deciding which navigational steps come next, recognizing instrument system failures), we observed more frequent and significant problems. Furthermore, performance on these cognitive tasks was associated with measures of how often pilots engaged in task-unrelated thought when cockpit automation was used.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              We found that while pilots’ instrument scanning and aircraft control skills are reasonably well retained when automation is used, the retention of cognitive skills needed for manual flying may depend on the degree to which pilots remain actively engaged in supervising the automation.},

Such factors were divided into those relating to (a) the human trustor, (b) the AI trustee, and (c) the shared context of their interaction.BackgroundThere are many factors influencing trust in robots, automation, and technology in general, and there have been several meta-analytic attempts to understand the antecedents of trust in these areas. However, no targeted meta-analysis has been performed examining the antecedents of trust in AI.MethodData from 65 articles examined the three predicted categories, as well as the subcategories of human characteristics and abilities, AI performance and attributes, and contextual tasking. Lastly, four common uses for AI (i.e., chatbots, robots, automated vehicles, and nonembodied, plain algorithms) were examined as further potential moderating factors.ResultsResults showed that all of the examined categories were significant predictors of trust in AI as well as many individual antecedents such as AI reliability and anthropomorphism, among many others.ConclusionOverall, the results of this meta-analysis determined several factors that influence trust, including some that have no bearing on AI performance. Additionally, we highlight the areas where there is currently no empirical research.ApplicationFindings from this analysis will allow designers to build systems that elicit higher or lower levels of trust, as they require.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous reliability of the modern airliner continues to make aviation a very safe mode of transport. This reliability does not however extend to pilots it would seem, with major lapses in performance during critical events a common theme in major incidents and accidents. The conditioned expectation of normalcy amongst pilots may contribute to underperformance during surprise critical events, resulting in poor handling of complex situations. The effects of startle, an autonomic reaction with deleterious effects on information processing, may be a strong contributor to poor pilot performance during critical events. These effects may seriously impair situational awareness, decision making and problem solving, all critical skills in the handling of a complex emergency. The startle reaction is examined from a cognitive perspective, followed by an analysis of several recent aircraft accidents where startle effects may have been strong contributory factors. The link between startle and pilot expectation for such events is discussed with implications for further research and interventions.},

	abstract = {The effects of fear/anticipatory anxiety on the acoustic startle reflex were investigated in humans using a paradigm involving anticipation of electric shocks. The eyeblink component of the startle reflex, elicited by an abrupt auditory stimulus, was measured in 9 normal volunteers during either the anticipation of electric shocks (anticipatory anxiety) or periods in which no shocks were anticipated (safe period). The eyeblink was consistently higher in amplitude, and shorter in latency, during periods when the subjects anticipated shocks, compared to the safe periods. This effect could not be attributed solely to a reduction in habituation and was statistically significant before the subjects actually received any shock (a single 30 mA stimulation on the median nerve). These results indicate that anticipatory anxiety can be measured objectively in humans using the fear-potentiated startle reflex in a paradigm not actually requiring any shock. Because a great deal is known about the neuroanatomical and pharmacological mechanisms of fear-potentiated startle in laboratory animals, this test procedure may be especially useful in humans to investigate the neurobiological substrates of anxiety disorders and their pharmacological treatments.},

	abstract = {The advent of very compact, very powerful digital computers has made it possible to automate a great many processes that formerly required large, complex machinery. Digital computers have made possible revolutionary changes in industry, commerce, and transportation. This book, an expansion and revision of the author's earlier technical papers on this subject, describes the development of automation in aircraft and in the aviation system, its likely evolution in the future, and the effects that these technologies have had -- and will have -- on the human operators and managers of the system. It suggests concepts that may be able to enhance human-machine relationships in future systems. The author focuses on the ability of human operators to work cooperatively with the constellation of machines they command and control, because it is the interactions among these system elements that result in the system's success or failure, whether in aviation or elsewhere.  Aviation automation has provided great social and technological benefits, but these benefits have not come without cost. In recent years, new problems in aircraft have emerged due to failures in the human-machine relationship. These incidents and accidents have motivated this inquiry into aviation automation. Similar problems in the air traffic management system are predicted as it becomes more fully automated. In particular, incidents and accidents have occurred which suggest that the principle problems with today's aviation automation are associated with its complexity, coupling, autonomy, and opacity. These problems are not unique to aviation; they exist in other highly dynamic domains as well. The author suggests that a different approach to automation -- called "human-centered automation" -- offers potential benefits for system performance by enabling a more cooperative human-machine relationship in the control and management of aircraft and air traffic.},

                        of AI technology in aviation decision-making, as well as examine how AI can
                        affect the transition from multi-crew to eMCO and SiPO, based on the
                        rationale that the single-pilot human operator having accessible data in a
                        timely and naturally interactive fashion could enhance natural decision
                        making (NDM) (Klein, 2008; Orasanu \& Fischer, 1997).According to the
                        industrial roadmaps, the first certification of assistance for pilots is
                        anticipated to occur in the year 2025, and this will be followed by a
                        gradual transition to full autonomy sometime around the year 2035. The
                        progression of events in the field of commercial air transport can be broken
                        down into three distinct stages:•First step: crew assistance/ augmentation
                        (2022-2025)•Second step: human/ machine collaboration (2025-2030)•Third
                        step: autonomous commercial air transport (2035+)There have been identified
                        two different operational concepts:Extended Minimum-Crew Operations (eMCOs),
                        formerly known as "Reduced Crew Operations," in which single-pilot
                        operations are permitted during the cruise phase of the flight with a level
                        of safety similar to that of today's two-pilot operations (to be implemented
                        beginning in the year 2025).Single-Pilot Operations (SiPOs), in which, at a
                        later stage, end-to-end single-pilot operations might be allowed, also based
                        on a level of safety equivalent to today's two-pilot operations, to be
                        implemented as of the year 2030. Single-Pilot Operations (SiPOs), in which,
                        at a later stage, end-to-end single-pilot operations might be allowed.The
                        proposed artificial intelligence aviation decision-making research in
                        cockpit design and users' experience was constructed by first surveying the
                        current literature about Artificial Intelligence (AI). The findings point to
                        the difficulties artificial intelligence poses, including its limitations
                        and users' resistance, in shifting from multi-crew operations to e-MCO and
                        SiPO. This resistance to change should be considered when designing any
                        potential upgrades to the AI cockpit design or user interactions. However,
                        the existing commercially available  AI technology may be ready to serve
                        some low-impact or non-time-critical applications (for example, weather in
                        destination and alternate airports update during the cruise phase) in this
                        transitional period to eMCOs and SiPOs, which would postpone the necessity
                        for a complete flight deck redesign at this time (Stanton \& Harris,
                        2015). The utilization of AI for the administration of systems and the
                        retrieval of information has the potential to improve both the perception
                        (Level 1 SA) and comprehension (Level 2 SA) of pilots (Endsley, 1995).
                        Therefore, the single-pilot human operator in the NDM cockpit environment
                        who has data accessible promptly and in a naturally engaging fashion would
                        be able to make judgments that are more fulfilling and closer to optimums in
                        the NDM environment (Klein, 2008; Orasanu \& Fischer, 1997).},

While numerous proven technologies, products and models have been successfully piloted, scaling them up through expansion, adoption and replication has proved challenging, particularly in poor regions of the world. The low uptake of innovations is partially attributed to the design of technologies, in a manner that is not compatible with local farming practices. At the same time, proven innovations fail to generate large impacts at scale because implementing actors have not sufficiently understood or effectively engaged with the scaling process. This article shares lessons from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) that supported applied research to develop, test and scale up promising food and nutrition security innovations. Key lessons include ensuring that innovations are embedded within local socio-ecological systems; engaging end users throughout the research process and enabling participatory decision-making; and considering the investment returns of innovations for end-users.},

However, while input traits have successfully been used and now form the basis of GM agriculture, output trait GM crops are still lagging behind after 20 years. This is despite the demonstrable benefits that some nutritionally enhanced crops would bring and the proven value of GM technologies. This Review considers the present state of nutritional enhancement through GM, highlighting two high-profile examples of nutritional enhancement—Golden Rice and omega-3 fish oil crops—systematically evaluating the progress, problems and pitfalls associated with the development of these traits. This includes not just the underlying metabolic engineering, but also the requirements to demonstrate efficacy and field performance of the crops and consideration of regulatory, intellectual property and consumer acceptance issues.},

	abstract = {Scaling up food security innovations in low-income rural environments has often failed to achieve substantive and lasting results. This poor performance can be attributed to dominant, linear approaches associated with spreading innovations which entail technology research and development and subsequent transfer to farmers. Such approaches tend to overlook complexity elements and non-linear processes in smallholder agriculture, including multiple stress factors such as climate variability and economic risks that make the uptake of new agricultural innovations more unpredictable. This article presents programmatic lessons from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF) on scaling up. It considers projects that: i) deployed successfully pilot-tested innovations to reach and benefit large numbers of beneficiaries; and projects that ii) used innovations as an entry point to catalyse systematic change in the food and agricultural sector. The paper also outlines several key scaling up principles that can encourage better understanding of relevant socio-ecological dynamics and complexities in intervention areas as a way to support innovations (at scale) that can contribute to more sustainable system outcomes. Finally, the paper reflects on how predominant definitions of impact at scale, centered around rather narrow indicators around economic growth and technology transfer, might consider more holistic goals that encompass integrated agricultural interventions that advance sustainable agri-food system outcomes.},

Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners' needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We highlight aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of AI fairness checklists, and suggest future design directions.},

	abstract = {Crew Resource Management (CRM) is the application of human factors knowledge and skills to ensure that teams make effective use of all resources. This includes ensuring that pilots bring in opinions of other teammates and utilize their unique capabilities. CRM was originally developed 40 years ago in response to a number of airline accidents in which the crew was found to be at fault. The goal was to improve teamwork among airline cockpit crews. The notion of “team” was later expanded to include cabin crew and ground resources. CRM has also been adopted by other industries, most notably medicine. Automation research now finds itself faced with similar issues to those faced by aviation 40 years ago: how to create a more robust system by making full use of both the automation and its human operators. With advances in machine intelligence, processing speed and cheap and plentiful memory, automation has advanced to the point that it can and should be treated as a teammate to fully take advantage of its capabilities and contributions to the system. This area of research is known as Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). Research on HAT has identified reusable patterns that can be applied in a wide range of applications. These patterns include features such as bi-directional communication and working agreements. This paper will explore the synergies between CRM and HAT. We believe that HAT research has much to learn from CRM and that there are benefits to expanding CRM to cover automation.},

	abstract = {Human-autonomy teams will likely first see use within environments with ethical considerations (e.g., military, healthcare). Therefore, we must consider how to best design an ethical autonomous teammate that can promote trust within teams, an antecedent to team effectiveness. In the current study, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with US Air Force pilots on the topics of autonomous teammates, trust, and ethics. A thematic analysis revealed that the pilots see themselves serving a parental role alongside a developing machine teammate. As parents, the pilots would feel responsible for their machine teammate’s behavior, and their unethical actions may not lead to a loss of trust. However, once the pilots feel their teammate has matured, their unethical actions would likely lower trust. To repair that trust, the pilots would want to understand their teammate’s processing, yet they are concerned about their ability to understand a machine’s processing. Additionally, the pilots would expect their teammates to indicate that it is improving or plans to improve. The findings from this study highlight the nuanced relationship between trust and ethics, as well as a duality of infantilized teammates that cannot bear moral weight and advanced machines whose decision-making processes may be incomprehensibly complex. Future investigations should further explore this parent–child paradigm and its relation to trust development and maintenance in human-autonomy teams.},

An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human–autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human–automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches.

	abstract = {Various levels of automation (LOA) designating the degree of human operator and computer control were explored within the context of a dynamic control task as a means of improving overall human/machine performance. Automated systems have traditionally been explored as binary function allocations; either the human or the machine is assigned to a given task. More recently, intermediary levels of automation have been discussed as a means of maintaining operator involvement in system performance, leading to improvements in situation awareness and reductions in out-of-the-loop performance problems. A LOA taxonomy applicable to a wide range of psychomotor and cognitive tasks is presented here. The taxonomy comprises various schemes of generic control system function allocations. The functions allocated to a human operator and/or computer included monitoring displays, generating processing options, selecting an ‘optimal’ option and implementing that option. The impact of the LOA taxonomy was assessed within a dynamic and complex cognitive control task by measuring its effect on human/system performance, situation awareness and workload. Thirty subjects performed simulation trials involving various levels of automation. Several automation failures occurred and out-of-the-loop performance decrements were assessed. Results suggest that, in terms of performance, human operators benefit most from automation of the implementation portion of the task, but only under normal operating conditions; in contrast, removal of the operator from task implementation is detrimental to performance recovery if the automated system fails. Joint human/system option generation significantly degraded performance in comparison to human or automated option generation alone. Lower operator workload and higher situation awareness were observed under automation of the decision making portion of the task (i.e. selection of options), although human/system performance was only slightly improved. The implications of these findings for the design of automated systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {Increasing the level of automation in air traffic management is seen as a measure to increase the performance of the service to satisfy the predicted future demand. This is expected to result in new roles for the human operator: he will mainly monitor highly automated systems and seldom intervene. Therefore, air traffic controllers (ATCos) would often work in a supervisory or control mode rather than in a direct operating mode. However, it has been demonstrated how human operators in such a role are affected by human performance issues, known as Out-Of-The-Loop (OOTL) phenomenon, consisting in lack of attention, loss of situational awareness and de-skilling. A countermeasure to this phenomenon has been identified in the adaptive automation (AA), i.e., a system able to allocate the operative tasks to the machine or to the operator depending on their needs. In this context, psychophysiological measures have been highlighted as powerful tool to provide a reliable, unobtrusive and real-time assessment of the ATCo’s mental state to be used as control logic for AA-based systems. In this paper, it is presented the so-called “Vigilance and Attention Controller”, a system based on electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) techniques, aimed to assess in real time the vigilance level of an ATCo dealing with a highly automated human–machine interface and to use this measure to adapt the level of automation of the interface itself. The system has been tested on 14 professional ATCos performing two highly realistic scenarios, one with the system disabled and one with the system enabled. The results confirmed that (i) long high automated tasks induce vigilance decreasing and OOTL-related phenomena; (ii) EEG measures are sensitive to these kinds of mental impairments; and (iii) AA was able to counteract this negative effect by keeping the ATCo more involved within the operative task. The results were confirmed by EEG and ET measures as well as by performance and subjective ones, providing a clear example of potential applications and related benefits of AA.},

	abstract = {Human supervisory control and monitoring of automated systems, as well as, passive system(s) information processing can all be classified as forms of out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance. Whether the operator's task is to decide if process control intervention is necessary, detect a critical system event, or accept or reject the actions of a computer controller, he or she is removed from direct, real-time control of the system. OOTL performance is a critical issue in overall automated systems functioning because it is associated with numerous negative consequences including: (a) operator failure to observe system parameter changes and intervene when necessary (vigilance decrements); (b) human over-trust in computer controllers (complacency); (c) operator loss of system or situation awareness; and (d) operator direct/manual control skill decay. These consequences have been found to impact human performance under both normal operating conditions and system failure modes, with a greater effect on the latter [15] leading to serious problems in operator ability to perform their assigned tasks when working with automated systems. Level of automation (LOA) has been put forth as an approach to ameliorating OOTL performance problems. It is intended to determine the optimal assignment of control between a human operator and computer in order to keep both involved in system operations. LOA considers the capabilities and capacities of both the human and computer controller in determining their optimal coupling. It constitutes a systems approach to resolving OOTL performance problems by minimizing the negative consequences associated with the removal of the operator from active system control, and allows for the strengths of both human decision making and computer processing to be realized. When compared to a technological approach that assesses only the capabilities of the computer in allocating as much responsibility to the machine as possible, and assigning the remaining tasks to the human operator, the advantages can be considerable. A LOA taxonomy will be presented along with research examining its utility in a dynamic control task. Using LOA to identify optimal combinations of human and computer control was found to produce improvements in system performance under intermediate levels. These levels involve joint human and computer control of various system functions, such as monitoring, planning, and option selection and implementation. Results indicated decreases in the number of system processes/tasks overlooked by operators. These improvements may translate into cost reductions due to improved operational safety and are anticipated to be applicable to process control operations.},

We conducted an experiment in a 3-axis motion flight simulator with 16 pilots equipped with an eye-tracker to analyze their behavior and eye movements during the occurrence of such a situation. The results revealed that this conflict engages participant's attentional abilities resulting in excessive and inefficient visual search patterns. This experiment confirmed the crucial need to design solutions for detecting the occurrence of conflictual situations and to assist the pilots. We therefore proposed an approach to formally identify the occurrence of "automation surprise" conflicts based on the analysis of "silent mode changes" of the autopilot. A demonstrator was implemented and allowed for the automatic trigger of messages in the cockpit that explains the autopilot behavior. We implemented a real-time demonstrator that was tested as a proof-of-concept with 7 subjects facing 3 different conflicts with automation. The results shown the efficacy of this approach which could be implemented in existing cockpits.},

It also affirms the upside of human factors in aviation - the positive contribution that it can make to the industry - and avoids placing undue emphasis on when the human component fails.    The book is divided into four main parts. Part one describes the underpinning science base, with chapters on human information processing, workload, situation awareness, decision making, error and individual differences. Part two of the book looks at the human in the system, containing chapters on pilot selection, simulation and training, stress, fatigue and alcohol, and environmental stressors. Part three takes a closer look at the machine (the aircraft), beginning with an examination of flight deck display design, followed by chapters on aircraft control, flight deck automation, and HCI on the flight deck. Part four completes the volume with a consideration of safety management issues, both on the flight deck and across the airline; the final chapter in this section looks at human factors for incident and accident investigation.  The book is written for professionals within the aviation industry, both on the flight deck and elsewhere, for post-graduate students and for researchers working in the area.},

Automation is often brittle, requiring constant human oversight to assure it operates as intended. This oversight has become harder as automation has become more complicated. To resolve this problem, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has been proposed. HAT is based on advances in providing automation transparency, a method for giving insight into the reasoning behind automated recommendations and actions, along with advances in human automation communications (e.g., voice). These, in turn, permit more trust in the automation when appropriate, and less when not, allowing a more targeted supervision of automated functions. This paper proposes a framework for HAT, incorporating three key tenets: transparency, bi-directional communication, and operator directed authority. These tenets, along with more capable automation, represent a shift in human-automation relations.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to systematically analyze the needs for single-pilot and reduced crew operations in commercial air transportation, and to develop human–autonomy teaming requirements to support future operations. In reduced crew operations, the pilot-flying operates the flight alone in the cockpit while the pilot-not-flying rests outside of the cockpit unless needed in high-workload situations. In single-pilot operations, there is only one pilot onboard to manage the flight. Many of the functions performed by the second pilot in dual-pilot operations would be replaced with an autonomous teammate. These increasingly autonomous systems will have capabilities that require it to be treated more like a member of the crew. Enhanced ground support will also support these flights. The transition from dual-pilot to single-pilot operations will require the redesign of the roles and responsibilities of the air and ground crew, crew resource management, function allocation, human–autonomy teaming, and procedures for normal and off-nominal situations. Document analysis, subject-matter-expert interviews, and pilot evaluations were conducted to analyze and compare concepts of operation, develop domain knowledge models, and develop human–autonomy teaming requirements to support pilot decision making and operations.},

	abstract = {Objective: The present article undertakes a systematic review of the current state of science for Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) and Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation. Background: SPO/RCO have been investigated with different methods from various disciplines and different organizations to make research progress. The results of federal agencies’, universities’, and EU-projects’ research activities have not been brought together for synthesis yet. Method: We systematically searched for SPO and RCO as independent and fixed search terms retrieving altogether 75 publications on the topic. Exclusion criteria were general and military aviation. Results: Establishing an appropriate function allocation to cope with high workload and off-nominal situations could be achieved by applying a variety of methods and the consideration of advanced automation systems. Their application is required to investigate pilot incapacitation and communication issues further. Data-link and certification issues were acknowledged in principle and have not been solved yet. Conclusion: In sum, experimental studies and modeling techniques of system ergonomics have addressed operational issues very well. Pilot health monitoring systems are less well elaborated than system protection. Future research needs to integrate different research findings and automation technologies. This is necessary to make RCO to a viable and attractive option for commercial development in aviation.

These changes would reduce the human element and thus, threaten the precept that “a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system.” NASA recently completed a pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attempting to quantify the pilot’s contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. These data show significant increases in workload for single pilot operations, compared to two-crew, with subjective assessments of safety and performance being significantly degraded as well. Nonetheless, in all cases, the pilots were able to overcome the failure mode effects in all crew configurations. These data reflect current-day flight deck equipage and help identify the technologies that may improve two-crew operations and/or possibly enable future reduced crew and/or single pilot operations.},

To explore in advance the problems that the introduction of SPO into the aviation system would bring, the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach has been widely used in the development of SPO. A systematic review of the progress of HCD approach in SPO research can promote further development of SPO. In this paper, the literature resources of SPO were ﬁrstly retrieved from scientiﬁc research databases by subject search and were used as the input of scientometric analysis to obtain the highly cited literature, the number of annual publications, and the co-authorship network, which enables readers to understand the research trends and research groups of current SPO. Secondly, the development, application, and research process of the HCD approach were introduced in detail, and the progress of the HCD approach in SPO research was reviewed systematically from three aspects: concept design, function allocation, and system evaluation. Finally, limitations of current SPO research and future research directions for applying the HCD approach to SPO were also discussed.},

	abstract = {Human supervisory control and monitoring of automated systems, as well as, passive system(s) information processing can all be classified as forms of out-of-the-loop (OOTL) performance. Whether the operator's task is to decide if process control intervention is necessary, detect a critical system event, or accept or reject the actions of a computer controller, he or she is removed from direct, real-time control of the system. OOTL performance is a critical issue in overall automated systems functioning because it is associated with numerous negative consequences including: (a) operator failure to observe system parameter changes and intervene when necessary (vigilance decrements); (b) human over-trust in computer controllers (complacency); (c) operator loss of system or situation awareness; and (d) operator direct/manual control skill decay. These consequences have been found to impact human performance under both normal operating conditions and system failure modes, with a greater effect on the latter [15] leading to serious problems in operator ability to perform their assigned tasks when working with automated systems. Level of automation (LOA) has been put forth as an approach to ameliorating OOTL performance problems. It is intended to determine the optimal assignment of control between a human operator and computer in order to keep both involved in system operations. LOA considers the capabilities and capacities of both the human and computer controller in determining their optimal coupling. It constitutes a systems approach to resolving OOTL performance problems by minimizing the negative consequences associated with the removal of the operator from active system control, and allows for the strengths of both human decision making and computer processing to be realized. When compared to a technological approach that assesses only the capabilities of the computer in allocating as much responsibility to the machine as possible, and assigning the remaining tasks to the human operator, the advantages can be considerable. A LOA taxonomy will be presented along with research examining its utility in a dynamic control task. Using LOA to identify optimal combinations of human and computer control was found to produce improvements in system performance under intermediate levels. These levels involve joint human and computer control of various system functions, such as monitoring, planning, and option selection and implementation. Results indicated decreases in the number of system processes/tasks overlooked by operators. These improvements may translate into cost reductions due to improved operational safety and are anticipated to be applicable to process control operations.},

	abstract = {There is perhaps no facet of modern society where the influence of computer automation has not been felt. Flight management systems for pilots, diagnostic and surgical aids for physicians, navigational displays for drivers, and decision-aiding systems for air-traffic controllers, represent only a few of the numerous domains in which powerful new automation technologies have been introduced. The benefits that have been reaped from this technological revolution have been many. At the same time, automation has not always worked as planned by designers, and many problems have arisen--from minor inefficiencies of operation to large-scale, catastrophic accidents. Understanding how humans interact with automation is vital for the successful design of new automated systems that are both safe and efficient.  The influence of automation technology on human performance has often been investigated in a fragmentary, isolated manner, with investigators conducting disconnected studies in different domains. There has been little contact between these endeavors, although principles gleaned from one domain may have implications for another. Also, with a few exceptions, the research has tended to be empirical and only theory-driven. In recent years, however, various groups of investigators have begun to examine human performance in automated systems in general and to develop theories of human interaction with automation technology.  This book presents the current theories and assesses the impact of automation on different aspects of human performance. Both basic and applied research is presented to highlight the general principles of human-computer interaction in several domains where automation technologies are widely implemented. The major premise is that a broad-based, theory-driven approach will have significant implications for the effective design of both current and future automation technologies.

We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

There are many benefits to be derived from automation; the question today is not whether a function can be automated, but whether it should be, due to various human factors issues. It is highly questionable whether total system safety is always enhanced by allocating functions to automatic devices rather than human operators, and there is some reason to believe that flight-deck automation may have already passed its optimum point. This is an age-old question in the human factors profession, and there are few guidelines available to the system designer. This paper presents the state-of-the-art in human factors in flight-deck automation, identifies a number of critical problem areas, and offers broad design guidelines. Some automation-related aircraft accidents and incidents are discussed as examples of human factors problems in automated flight.},

	abstract = {Rising fuel and operating expenses for commercial airline operators coupled with a predicted pilot labor shortage drives the need for a reduction in costs while continuing to service passengers. One possible solution to reduce recurring costs and mitigate the effects of a pilot shortage is the transition to a single pilot cockpit. Three different design alternatives for implementing a single pilot cockpit in commercial domestic jetliners were identified: the no change option represented by a two pilot cockpit, a single pilot with no additional support, and a single pilot with an onboard support system that automates some of the removed copilot roles. Design alternatives were evaluated using three models: (1) life-cycle cost, (2) reliability, and the (3) processing times for flight procedures based on a human processor simulation. The lifecycle cost model was used to determine the savings generated by a single pilot cockpit. Reliability analysis was done to establish failure rates relative to the target level of safety. A human performance model was developed to evaluate the time on task for each task in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) for each alternative. The procedure models were decomposed into component tasks and actions required to complete the procedure. The ranking of alternative designs during utility/cost analysis was found to be (1) the no change option, (2) the single pilot with an onboard support system, and (3) the single pilot with no additional support. We found a tradeoff between the two pilot utility and single pilot with onboard support through cost savings. Based on the analysis of results, the single pilot with an onboard support system was judged to have the best chance for becoming a realistic single pilot cockpit system which will reduce recurring airline operating costs, maintain or improve flight safety, and maintain airline serviceability.},

Design/methodology/approach – After describing what is meant by a socio‐technical system, the paper uses four short case studies to illustrate the benefits and dis‐benefits of using (or failing to use) a socio‐technical systems approach. Findings – Readers are encouraged to acknowledge the role of the human being in a wider system context. It is also suggested that improving individual aspects of airline operations in isolation may not actually improve overall efficiency. Research/limitations/implications – The case studies discussed are meant to be illustrative of the socio‐technical systems approach rather than an authoritative review of the area. Practical implications – The practical implications of adopting a socio‐technical systems view of improvements aimed at improving efficiency are emphasised in that with early consideration of system changes bottlenecks may be identified which will reduce the efficacy of these changes. Originality/value – Possibly the first attempt at providing a wider socio‐technical systems framework for the assessment of operational efficiency explicitly incorporating the role of the human in the system.},

	abstract = {Human?automation interaction (HAI) takes place in virtually every high-technology domain under a variety of operational conditions. Because operators make HAI decisions such as which mode to use, and when to engage, disengage, monitor, or cross-check automation, it is important to understand their perceptions of how system and situational characteristics affect their interaction with automation. The objective of this study was to examine how systematic variations of automation interface, task and context features influence professional pilots? judgments of HAI situations. Pilots received descriptions of crews interacting with flight deck automation in specific situations and were asked to rate cognitive demands and predict behaviors. Results reflect a complex interplay among automation features, task, and context. Automation features influenced judgments of workload, task management, and potential for automation-related errors; however, the impact of automation on situation awareness seems to be moderated by task features. Unanticipated tasks had broader effects on pilots? judgments than operational stressors. Results suggest that although changes to automated systems may be small in technical terms, their cognitive and behavioral impact on operators may be significant. Performance effects of automation changes in aviation as well as other domains need to be addressed with reference to task characteristics and situational demands.},

Recent emergence of Global Navigation Satellite Systems and satellite-based augmentation systems have enabled higher precision execution of aircraft trajectories, opening-up the potential for the implementing more quantitative air traffic management approaches. Already, this navigation capability is enabling higher traffic through puts, and safer operation of aircraft in the proximity of the terrain at several major airports in the US. This paper discusses the aircraft trajectory optimization, conflict resolution algorithms, and traffic flow management problems which form the essential components of the evolving air traffic management system. It will be shown that Optimal Control Theory, Model Predictive Control and the Discrete Event Systems theory form the underlying analytical machinery in this domain. Finally, the paper will outline some of the algorithms for realizing the Trajectory Based Operations concept, currently being developed for future air traffic management.},

	abstract = {The cooperation of a human pilot with an autonomous agent during flight control realizes parallel autonomy. We propose an air-guardian system that facilitates cooperation between a pilot with eye tracking and a parallel end-to-end neural control system. Our vision-based air-guardian system combines a causal continuous-depth neural network model with a cooperation layer to enable parallel autonomy between a pilot and a control system based on perceived differences in their attention profiles. The attention profiles for neural networks are obtained by computing the networks' saliency maps (feature importance) through the VisualBackProp algorithm, while the attention profiles for humans are either obtained by eye tracking of human pilots or saliency maps of networks trained to imitate human pilots. When the attention profile of the pilot and guardian agents align, the pilot makes control decisions. Otherwise, the air-guardian makes interventions and takes over the control of the aircraft. We show that our attention-based air-guardian system can balance the trade-off between its level of involvement in the flight and the pilot's expertise and attention. The guardian system is particularly effective in situations where the pilot was distracted due to information overload. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for navigating flight scenarios in simulation with a fixed-wing aircraft and on hardware with a quadrotor platform.},

	abstract = {We reflect briefly on the last forty years or so of ergonomics and human factors research in automation, observing that many of the issues being discussed today are the same as all those decades ago. In this paper, we explicate one of the key arguments regarding the application of automation in complex safety-critical domains, which proposes restraining the capabilities of automation technology until it is able to fully and completely take over the task at hand. We call this the ‘cliff-edge’ principle of automation design. Instead, we espouse a use for the technology in a more problem-driven, human-centred way. These are not entirely new ideas and such a philosophy is already gaining traction in ergonomics and human factors. The point is that in a given system, tasks should be controlled either by human or by automation; anything in between only causes problems for system performance. Human factors problems with automation have been with us for over forty years, and have changed little in that time. This brief review shows a groundswell of opinion that points to what we call the cliff-edge automation principle – restraining the full capabilities of technology until it is ready to fully and completely take over the task. This approach improves human performance in the system by keeping them in the loop and in control. Researchers and practitioners in ergonomics and human factors should continue to push this message to the designers and manufacturers of automated systems.},

	abstract = {In the coming decade, Artificial Intelligence-based Digital Assistants are likely to appear in operational aviation contexts, including the cockpit and air traffic control Ops room. Current scenarios for such AI support include advising flight crew during mid-flight emergencies, and executing routine air traffic duties in the Tower to reduce complexity and controller workload. The concept for Digital Assistants goes beyond today’s Machine Learning-based tools, which largely offer information to human operators. Instead, the notion is of an AI-based ‘colleague’ that can engage in dialogue with its human counterparts. This in turn leads to the notion of a Human-AI Team and raises a host of questions about how such a team can and should function to optimise system performance and safety. One question in particular concerns how working with a Digital Assistant, and even potentially relying on one in safety critical scenarios, will affect the team’s, and the parent organisation’s safety culture, since safety culture is seen as high in the industry, and valuable in assuring passenger and crew safety. In the European air traffic network, safety culture is measured regularly in different countries using a standardised 50-item scientifically validated questionnaire. This questionnaire has been applied to the Digital Assistant concept to see which facets of safety culture might be affected. The results of this analysis have identified six high-level concerns, but also six instances where the Digital Assistant could potentially reinforce or improve safety culture, providing new ‘safety affordances’. Although the current work’s focus is on aviation, the safety culture issues raised here may also pertain to other domains including health care, the energy sector, space and defence systems.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              To provide an overview of concepts of operation for single pilot operations (SPO) and a synthesis of recently published work evaluating these concepts.
            
            
              Background:
              Advances in technology have made it possible for a commercial aircraft to be flown by a single pilot under normal conditions, and research is being conducted to examine the feasibility of implementing SPO for commercial aviation.
            
            
              Method:
              Context leading up to the consideration of SPO for commercial flight is provided, including the benefits and challenges. Recent studies examining issues relating to automation, operations, and communications in the SPO context are presented.
            
            
              Results:
              A number of concepts have been proposed and tested for SPO, and no one concept has been shown to be superior. Single pilots were able to successfully resolve off-nominal scenarios with either the ground-support or cockpit-automation tools examined. However, the technologies developed in support of these concepts are in prototype forms and need further development.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              There have been no obvious “show stoppers” for moving toward SPO. However, the current state of research is in its initial stages, and more research is needed to examine other challenges associated with SPO. Moreover, human factors researchers must continue to be involved in the development of the new tools and technologies to support SPO to ensure their effectiveness.
            
            
              Application:
              The research issues highlighted in the context of SPO reflect issues that are associated with the process of reducing crew members or providing remote support of operators and, more generally, human interactions with increasingly autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the next and forthcoming evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Though there could be significant benefits to society, there are also concerns that AGI could pose an existential threat. The critical role of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) in the design of safe, ethical, and usable AGI has been emphasized; however, there is little evidence to suggest that HFE is currently influencing development programs. Further, given the broad spectrum of HFE application areas, it is not clear what activities are required to fulfill this role. This article presents the perspectives of 10 researchers working in AI safety on the potential risks associated with AGI, the HFE concepts that require consideration during AGI design, and the activities required for HFE to fulfill its critical role in what could be humanity's final invention. Though a diverse set of perspectives is presented, there is broad agreement that AGI potentially poses an existential threat, and that many HFE concepts should be considered during AGI design and operation. A range of critical activities are proposed, including collaboration with AGI developers, dissemination of HFE work in other relevant disciplines, the embedment of HFE throughout the AGI lifecycle, and the application of systems HFE methods to help identify and manage risks.},

In this review, we do a deep dive into human–autonomy teams (HATs) by explaining the differences between automation and autonomy and by reviewing the domain of human–human teaming to make inferences for HATs. We examine the domain of human–human teaming to extrapolate a few core factors that could have relevance for HATs. Notably, these factors involve critical social elements within teams that are central (as argued in this review) for HATs. We conclude by highlighting some research gaps that researchers should strive toward answering, which will ultimately facilitate a more nuanced and complete understanding of HATs in a variety of real-world contexts.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Research has shown that lack of non-technical skills (also called, Crew Resource Management – CRM) contributes to most personal and process safety incidents in high-risk industries. Situational awareness in the most influential non-technical skill. Authors developed a disruptive program to generate situational awareness competencies and improve non-technical skills of front-line employees. The program is called: Permanent Attention. It combines best practices adapted from high-risk industries and industrial psychology science to generate statistically significant improvements in situational awareness competencies through a sustainable approach.
            The paper shows real case applications from two organizations where the Permanent Attention program has generated significant improvement in the participants’ situational awareness competency and non-technical skills (CRM) acquisition and retention. The program is executed with the learner at the centre of the process. The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT, Endsley, and Garland, 2000) is used to measure the levels of situational awareness competency before and after the training, to determine the impact achieved through the program. The ‘Repeated measures – ANOVA’ statistic model is used to scientifically demonstrate the significant impact of the process in the three elements of situational awareness: Attention, Comprehension and Anticipation.
            The training sessions in-between SAGATs contain theoretical information and practical exercises that equip the participant(s) with fundamentals. Exercises for each element of the situational awareness have been designed to obtain optimal skills. To complement the practice of non-technical skills, employees are exposed to simulations of critical operational situations, so they can demonstrate their leadership, communications, teamwork, decision-making skills in group and learn how to manage stress in such situations.
            The levels of situational awareness competencies are periodically monitored via practical field-based SAGAT exercises after the training, to ensure a sustained improvement in the participants’ competencies. The feedback provided immediately after each SAGAT is key to let the participant focus on the element(s) of situational awareness that require improvement. Once the feedback is received, the participant is requested to self-evaluate her level on each element of situational awareness. This reinforces self-consciousness and encourages a sense of commitment to improve by conviction, not by imposition.
            This novel methodology gives the organization a clear metric on the return on the investment the program offers and allows very specific interventions to improve individual and group level non-technical skills across the organization. A truly disruptive method.
            The paper shows how the Permanent Attention instructional design combines Endsley's research from the aviation and nuclear industries, with Knowles’ andragogy (2015) theory to achieve competency acquisition and retention. Novel approaches such as the SAGAT, are used with scenarios that are familiar to the target population. Participants’ levels of situational awareness competency are measured before and after the training to determine whether a statistically significant impact was achieved through the program.
            Permanent Attention has been implemented in organizations with a wide range of maturity. Case-studies are presented to illustrate the process, results, and limitations in two leading drilling companies, in which 60 to 70\% of incidents had situational awareness as a contributing factor, over last five years. The implementation of the program has brought statistically significant improvements in the competency of employees and the pilot in Colombia has shown early signs of accident reduction.},

	abstract = {Theories and models are central to Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) sciences for producing new knowledge, pushing the boundaries of the field, and providing a basis for designing systems that can improve human performance. Despite the key role, there has been less attention to what constitutes a good theory/model and how to examine the relative worth of different theories/models. This study aims to bridge this gap by (1) proposing a set of criteria for evaluating models in HFE, (2) employing a methodological approach to utilize the proposed criteria, and (3) evaluating the existing models of trust in automation (TiA) according to the proposed criteria. The resulting work provides a reference guide for researchers to examine the existing models’ performance and to make meaningful comparisons between TiA models. The results also shed light on the differences among TiA models in satisfying the criteria. While conceptual models offer valuable insights into identifying the causal factors, their limitation in operationalization poses a major challenge in terms of testability and empirical validity. On the other hand, although more readily testable and possessing higher predictive power, computational models are confined to capturing only partial causal factors and have reduced explanatory power capacity. The study concludes with recommendations that in order to advance as a scientific discipline, HFE should adopt modelling approaches that can help us understand the complexities of human performance in dynamic sociotechnical systems.},

This is done to highlight research questions which must be answered by the field. Prioritizing these questions will mitigate the risk of current research efforts being wasted. We used Hoff and Bashir’s (2015) model consisting of learned trust, situational trust, and dispositional trust to structure our review wherein we identified research gaps and discrepancies in the trust in systems literature. Our review contains 17 research questions that will need to be answered before researchers understand how users form trust in systems.

The pH and PCO2 of the control perfusate were 7.40 and 39 mmHg, respectively. In the rabbit septum a metabolic acidosis (pH equals 6.82, PCO2 equals 39 mmHg) caused a loss of 16\% of control tension in 12 min. Na+ and K+ exchange were unaltered. A comparable respiratory acidosis (pH equals 6.81, PCO2 equals 159 mmHg) caused a 51\% loss of tension in 2 min. Na+ exchange was unaltered but K+ efflux fell from 8.9 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- SE) to 4.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/kg dry wt per min (P less than 0.001, n equals 10). A net gain of K+ of 16.9 +/- 1.7 (n equals 14) mmol/kg dry wt occurred and was attributable to a delayed fall in K+ influx relative to efflux over 15 min. The net gain could not be mimicked by epinephrine administration or blocked by propranolol and was absent in the beating rat septum and the quiescent rabbit septum. These results suggest that the net uptake of K+, which appears to be dependent on a period of depolarization, and the changes of contractility are controlled by the H+ ion concentration at a cellular site whose exchange with the extracellular space is characterized by a considerable restriction of diffusion. Changes of contractility are not related to the net uptake of K+.},

	abstract = {Human-autonomy teams aim to leverage the different strengths of humans and autonomous systems respectively to exceed the individual capabilities of each through collaboration. Highly effective human teams develop and utilize a shared mental model (SMM): a synchronized understanding of the external world and of the tasks, responsibilities, capabilities, and limits of each team member. Recent works assert that the same should apply to human-autonomy teams; however, contemporary AI commonly consists of “black box” systems, whose internal processes can not easily be viewed or interpreted. Users can easily develop inaccurate mental models of such systems, impeding SMM development and thus team performance.We seek ways to support the human’s side of Human-AI SMMs in the context of AI-advised Decision Making, a form of teaming in which an AI suggests a solution to a human operator, who is responsible for the final decision. This work focuses on improving shared situation awareness by providing more context to the AI’s internal processing. We hypothesize that this will lead the human to a more accurate mental model of the task and the AI, which in turn will improve team performance. We manipulate the human’s situation awareness of the task environment and measure effects on the shared mental model. A between-subjects, randomized experiment is conducted in which participants in 6 treatment groups of varying amounts of contextual information (as a proxy for situation awareness) complete a task with an AI teammate. We find that improving shared situation awareness of decision points improves the human’s overall performance, as well as their understanding of their AI teammate, without directly explaining the AI’s internal mechanisms. Additionally, we find that increasing the human’s situation awareness of task environment and AI teammate reduces over-reliance on the automated teammate.},

	abstract = {This theoretical model of emotion is based on research using the startle-probe methodology. It explains inconsistencies in probe studies of attention and fear conditioning and provides a new approach to emotional perception, imagery, and memory. Emotions are organized biphasically, as appetitive or aversive (defensive). Reflexes with the same valence as an ongoing emotional state are augmented; mismatched reflexes are inhibited. Thus, the startle response (an aversive reflex) is enhanced during a fear state and is diminished in a pleasant emotional context. This affect–startle effect is not determined by general arousal, simple attention, or probe modality. The effect is found when affects are prompted by pictures or memory images, changes appropriately with aversive conditioning, and may be dependent on right-hemisphere processing. Implications for clinical, neurophysiological and basic research in emotion are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Decades of stringent oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have contributed to the flying public’s confidence in aviation and, as a result, the unprecedented growth of commercial air travel. However, after the tragic loss of passengers in two Boeing 737 MAX crashes, grave flaws have been identified in the contemporary framework of the FAA’s aircraft design approval process. The presence of these flaws may persuade courts to limit the preemptive effect of aircraft certification regulations and to expand the role that state tort obligations have in remedying the failures in FAA oversight. This Comment examines the identified flaws in FAA certification, discusses one such decision rejecting the preemptive force of certification, and suggests that endorsing this decision may be an important stopgap measure to address the oversight failures revealed by the 737 MAX.},

One of the papers provides a thorough review on theoretical aspects of agent transparency and empirical findings on operator performance, situation awareness, trust and workload, among other outcomes. These measures are also among some of the most common metrics reported in studies in this special issue.},

	abstract = {As machines and agents become more autonomous, it has been increasingly clear to human factors/ergonomics researchers and practitioners that agent transparency is a critical issue for effective human-agent teaming. Transparency methods can provide the foundation for establishing shared awareness and shared intent between humans and intelligent machines. However, to date, the existing body of research on agent transparency has not been systematically documented. The purpose of this article is to summarize and evaluate current psychological theories and empirical evidence regarding effective agent transparency in human-autonomy teaming. We start by examining how transparency has been operationalized in the literature by discussing the two prominent theoretical frameworks of human-autonomy teaming. We then present a review of the empirical findings concerning how transparency affects key human-autonomy teaming variables, such as operator accuracy, decision time, situation awareness, perceived usability, and workload. This article includes an overview of the experimental tasks, scenarios, and interfaces that have been used in past studies and synthesizes how transparency has been operationalized and manipulated by prior studies. We then summarize the results and conclude by providing key recommendations for future research.},

The Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model was proposed to support human awareness in human–agent teams. As agents transition from tools to artificial teammates, an expansion of the model is necessary to support teamwork paradigms, which require bidirectional transparency. We propose that an updated model can better inform human–agent interaction in paradigms involving more advanced agent teammates. This paper describes the model's use in three programmes of research, which exemplify the utility of the model in different contexts – an autonomous squad member, a mediator between a human and multiple subordinate robots, and a plan recommendation agent. Through this review, we show that the SAT model continues to be an effective tool for facilitating shared understanding and proper calibration of trust in human–agent teams.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to show the current situation and additional requirements for the aircraft automation systems based on the lessons learned from the two 737 MAX crashes. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the Swiss cheese model was used to find the real root causes of the 737 MAX accidents. Then, the results have been compared with the actions taken by the manufacturers and authorities. Based on the comparison, the necessary improvements to prevent such accidents are defined. Regarding the faulty sensor that forms the accidents, a synthetic sensor was developed using an aerodynamic model. Findings It has been proven that the safety-critical automation systems should not be designed by relying on a single set of sensor data. Automation levels should be defined in a standard way. Depending on the defined automation level, the system must be designed as either fail-safe or fail-operational system. When designing backup systems, it should be decided by looking at not only whether it has power but also the accuracy of the incoming signals. Practical implications Aviation certification requirements related to automation systems need to be revised and improved. With this context, it was revealed that the certification processes for automation systems should be re-evaluated and updated by aviation authorities, especially Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Originality/value Task sharing between automation system and pilot based on the classification of automation levels and determining certification requirements accordingly has been brought to the agenda. A synthetic Angle of Attack sensor was developed by using an aerodynamic model for fault detection and diagnosis.},

The data from 20 different studies were used to generate 35 different data points that compared performance with varying levels of unreliability, with that of a non-automated baseline condition. A regression analysis of benefits/costs relative to baseline was carried out, and revealed a strong linear function of benefits with reliability. The analysis revealed that a reliability of 0.70 was the ‘crossover point’ below which unreliable automation was worse than no automation at all. The analysis also revealed that performance was more strongly affected by reliability in high workload conditions, implicating the role of workload-imposed automation dependence in producing this relationship, and suggesting that humans tend to protect performance of concurrent tasks from imperfection of diagnostic automation.},

	abstract = {We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for deciding which system functions should be automated and to what extent. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

	abstract = {The perceptual cycle model (PCM) has been widely applied in ergonomics research in domains including road, rail and aviation. The PCM assumes that information processing occurs in a cyclical manner drawing on top-down and bottom-up influences to produce perceptual exploration and actions. However, the validity of the model has not been addressed. This paper explores the construct validity of the PCM in the context of aeronautical decision-making. The critical decision method was used to interview 20 helicopter pilots about critical decision-making. The data were qualitatively analysed using an established coding scheme, and composite PCMs for incident phases were constructed. It was found that the PCM provided a mutually exclusive and exhaustive classification of the information-processing cycles for dealing with critical incidents. However, a counter-cycle was also discovered which has been attributed to skill-based behaviour, characteristic of experts. The practical applications and future research questions are discussed.Practitioner Summary: This paper explores whether information processing, when dealing with critical incidents, occurs in the manner anticipated by the perceptual cycle model. In addition to the traditional processing cycle, a reciprocal counter-cycle was found. This research can be utilised by those who use the model as an accident analysis framework.},

This approach neglects relational aspects of increasingly capable automation and system-level outcomes, such as cooperation and resilience. To address these limitations, we adopt a relational framing of trust based on the decision situation, semiotics, interaction sequence, and strategy. This relational framework stresses that the goal is not to maximize trust, or to even calibrate trust, but to support a process of trusting through automation responsivity.ConclusionThis framing clarifies why future work on trust in automation should consider not just individual characteristics and how automation influences people, but also how people can influence automation and how interdependent interactions affect trusting automation. In these new technological and organizational contexts that shift human operators to co-operators of automation, automation responsivity and the ability to resolve conflicting goals may be more relevant than reliability and reliance for advancing system design.ApplicationA conceptual model comprising four concepts?situation, semiotics, strategy, and sequence?can guide future trust research and design for automation responsivity and more resilient human?automation systems.},

	abstract = {Taking an integrated, systems approach to dealing exclusively with the human performance issues encountered on the flight deck of the modern airliner, this book describes the inter-relationships between the various application areas of human factors, recognising that the human contribution to the operation of an airliner does not fall into neat pigeonholes. The relationship between areas such as pilot selection, training, flight deck design and safety management is continually emphasised within the book. It also affirms the upside of human factors in aviation - the positive contribution that it can make to the industry - and avoids placing undue emphasis on when the human component fails. The book is divided into four main parts. Part one describes the underpinning science base, with chapters on human information processing, workload, situation awareness, decision making, error and individual differences. Part two of the book looks at the human in the system, containing chapters on pilot selection, simulation and training, stress, fatigue and alcohol, and environmental stressors. Part three takes a closer look at the machine (the aircraft), beginning with an examination of flight deck display design, followed by chapters on aircraft control, flight deck automation, and HCI on the flight deck. Part four completes the volume with a consideration of safety management issues, both on the flight deck and across the airline; the final chapter in this section looks at human factors for incident and accident investigation. The book is written for professionals within the aviation industry, both on the flight deck and elsewhere, for post-graduate students and for researchers working in the area.},

Nowhere is TM as important as it is in dealing with non-normal situations. The objective of this study was to analyze pilot TM behavior for non-normal situations. Specifically, the study observed pilots' performance in a full workload environment in order to discern their TM strategies. This study identified four different TM prioritization and allocation strategies: ‘Aviate-Navigate-Communicate-Manage Systems’; ‘Perceived Severity;’ ‘Procedure Based;’ and ‘Event/Interrupt Driven.’ Subjects used these strategies to manage their personal workload and to schedule monitoring and assessment of the situation. The ‘Perceived Severity’ strategy for personal workload management combined with the ‘Aviate-Navigate-Communicate- Manage Systems’ strategy for monitoring and assessing appeared to be the most effective (fewest errors and fastest response times) in responding to the novel system failure used in this study.},

As the sophistication of automation has increased, some traditional input devices in the cockpit, such as throttle levers, yokes, and switches, have unobtrusively changed the way they work. Instead of operating the same way at all times, the behavior of these input devices has become context-sensitive (i.e., “moded”). It is well known in human factors design that nonsalient moded input devices require increased cognitive workload and can result in a startle, surprise, and confusion. An analysis of modern airliner cockpits identified three types of moded input devices: 1) disabled, 2) alternative behavior, and 3) command override. The implications of these results on cockpit design, certification, and flight crew training are discussed.},

LOA taxonomies have been very useful in guiding understanding of how automation affects human cognition and performance, with several practical and theoretical benefits. Over the past several decades a wide body of research has been conducted on the impact of various LOAs on human performance, workload, and situation awareness (SA). LOA has a significant effect on operator SA and level of engagement that helps to ameliorate out-of-the-loop performance problems. Together with other aspects of system design, including adaptive automation, granularity of control, and automation interface design, LOA is a fundamental design characteristic that determines the ability of operators to provide effective oversight and interaction with system autonomy. LOA research provides a solid foundation for guiding the creation of effective human–automation interaction, which is critical for the wide range of autonomous and semiautonomous systems currently being developed across many industries.},

	abstract = {As autonomous and semiautonomous systems are developed for automotive, aviation, cyber, robotics and other applications, the ability of human operators to effectively oversee and interact with them when needed poses a significant challenge. An automation conundrum exists in which as more autonomy is added to a system, and its reliability and robustness increase, the lower the situation awareness of human operators and the less likely that they will be able to take over manual control when needed. The human–autonomy systems oversight model integrates several decades of relevant autonomy research on operator situation awareness, out-of-the-loop performance problems, monitoring, and trust, which are all major challenges underlying the automation conundrum. Key design interventions for improving human performance in interacting with autonomous systems are integrated in the model, including human–automation interface features and central automation interaction paradigms comprising levels of automation, adaptive automation, and granularity of control approaches. Recommendations for the design of human–autonomy interfaces are presented and directions for future research discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Identify a critical research gap for the human factors community that has implications for successful human–automation teaming.
            
            
              Background
              There are a variety of approaches for applying automation in systems. Flexible application of automation such that its level and/or type changes during system operations has been shown to enhance human–automation system performance.
            
            
              Method
              This mini-review describes flexible automation in which the level of automated support varies across tasks during system operation, rather than remaining fixed. Two types distinguish the locus of authority to change automation level: adaptable automation (the human operator assigns how automation is applied) has been found to aid human’s situation awareness and provide more perceived control versus adaptive automation (the system assigns automation level) that may impose less workload and attentional demands by automatically adjusting levels in response to changes in one or more states of the human, task, environment, and so on.
            
            
              Results
              In contrast to vast investments in adaptive automation approaches, limited research has been devoted to adaptable automation. Experiments directly comparing adaptable and adaptive automation are particularly scant. These few studies show that adaptable automation was not only preferred over adaptive automation, but it also resulted in improved task performance and, notably, less perceived workload.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Systematic research examining adaptable automation is overdue, including hybrid approaches with adaptive automation. Specific recommendations for further research are provided.
            
            
              Application
              Adaptable automation together with effective human-factored interface designs to establish working agreements are key to enabling human–automation teaming in future complex systems.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveIn this review, we investigate the relationship between agent transparency, Situation Awareness, mental workload, and operator performance for safety critical domains.BackgroundThe advancement of highly sophisticated automation across safety critical domains poses a challenge for effective human oversight. Automation transparency is a design principle that could support humans by making the automation?s inner workings observable (i.e., ?seeing-into?). However, experimental support for this has not been systematically documented to date.MethodBased on the PRISMA method, a broad and systematic search of the literature was performed focusing on identifying empirical research investigating the effect of transparency on central Human Factors variables.ResultsOur final sample consisted of 17 experimental studies that investigated transparency in a controlled setting. The studies typically employed three human-automation interaction types: responding to agent-generated proposals, supervisory control of agents, and monitoring only. There is an overall trend in the data pointing towards a beneficial effect of transparency. However, the data reveals variations in Situation Awareness, mental workload, and operator performance for specific tasks, agent-types, and level of integration of transparency information in primary task displays.ConclusionOur data suggests a promising effect of automation transparency on Situation Awareness and operator performance, without the cost of added mental workload, for instances where humans respond to agent-generated proposals and where humans have a supervisory role.ApplicationStrategies to improve human performance when interacting with intelligent agents should focus on allowing humans to see into its information processing stages, considering the integration of information in existing Human Machine Interface solutions.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, automated systems on modern commercial flight decks have increased dramatically. Pilots now regularly interact and share tasks with these systems. This interaction has led human factors research to direct more attention to the pilot's cognitive processing and mental model of the information flow occurring on the flight deck. The experiment reported herein investigated how pilots mentally represent and process information typically available during flight. Fifty-two commercial pilots participated in tasks that required them to provide similarity ratings for pairs of flight-deck information and to prioritize this information under two contextual conditions. Pilots processed the information along three cognitive dimensions. These dimensions included the flight function and the flight action that the information supported and how frequently pilots refer to the information. Pilots classified the information as aviation, navigation, communications, or systems administration information. Prioritization results indicated a high degree of consensus among pilots, while scaling results revealed two dimensions along which information is prioritized. Pilot cognitive workload for flight-deck tasks and the potential for using these findings to operationalize cognitive metrics are evaluated. Such measures may be useful additions for flight-deck human performance evaluation.},

This debate can range from the details contained within aircraft flight manuals to computer-based versus simulator-based training. While some questions are still under consideration, most fall short in the understanding of how pilots “actually” learn. The researchers conducted a longitudinal study focusing on pilot learning; through interviews, observations, and field documentation, 10 pilot trainees from two regional airlines were followed for 5 months throughout their initial airline training. Using joint cognitive systems theory, and concepts from curriculum theory to understand the utility of training programs, the study revealed gaps between the airlines’ intended learning outcomes and the trainees’ actual experiences. The findings demonstrate that automation, as opposed to other aircraft systems, may require different approaches to learning. Recommendations for possible modifications to current pilot training are discussed.},

	title = {Making {Brittle} {Technologies} {Useful}},
	abstract = {One of the continuing challenges for Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE) is the need to develop a deeper understanding of how cognitive tools influence operator performance, consistent with one of the fundamental precepts of CSE that “automation does not simply supplant human activity but rather changes it, often in ways unintended and unanticipated by the designers of automation”. Equally important is the need for CSE as a field to influence the design decisions of system developers.
One of the barriers to achieving these goals has been the temptation to apply labels that easily resonate with audiences, but that fail to provide the insights necessary to guide the design and functioning of operational systems. As an example from the annals of cognitive psychology, we have a misleading label such as “confirmation bias". Within the CSE literature itself, I find similar issues with labels such as “complacency”.
In this chapter, I first describe the history of the label “confirmation bias” to illustrate how such a misleading label can focus attention on motivational influences on behavior without adequately considering the adaptive cognitive processes that, under very narrow and unusual circumstances, can incorrectly make it appear as if people are motivated to avoid those data that could reject a hypothesis that they have generated. The goal of this initial discussion is to highlight the need for designers to more deeply understand the cognitive processes that drive and support human performance and to emphasize that such cognitive processes need to be understood in context.
This initial discussion then serves as a lead-in to a more detailed consideration of labels such as “compliance” and “overreliance” as they have been applied to the impact of brittle technologies on human performance. This broader focus emphasizes the need to understand joint human-machine systems in terms of the interplay of the task and broader environmental context with the design of a new technology (cognitive tool) and its impacts on the cognitive processes of the human operator(s). In this discussion, models based on attention, perception, memory and problem solving processes are outlined, along with consideration of design solutions that support these cognitive processes more effectively.},

We review approaches to function allocation in the context of human machine teaming with technology that exhibits high levels of autonomy (e.g., unmanned aerial systems). Although most function allocation projects documented in the literature have employed a single method, we advocate for an integrated approach that leverages four key activities: (1) analyzing operational demands and work requirements; (2) exploring alternative distribution of work across person and machine agents that make up a human machine team (HMT); (3) examining interdependencies between human and autonomous technologies required for effective HMT performance under routine and off-nominal (unexpected) conditions; and (4) exploring the trade-space of alternative HMT options. Our literature review identified methods to support each of these activities. In combination, they enable system designers to uncover, explore, and weigh a range of critical design considerations beyond those emphasized by the MABA–MABA (“Men are better at, Machines are better at”) and Levels of Automation function allocation traditions. Example applications are used to illustrate the value of these methods to design of HMT that includes autonomous machine agents.},

In this physics-in-progress, we review the shift from laboratory studies, which have been unable to advance the science of autonomy, to a theory of autonomy in open and uncertain environments based on autonomous human systems along with supporting evidence in the field. We attribute the need for this shift to the social sciences being primarily focused on a science of individual agents, whether for humans or machines, a focus that has been unable to generalize to new situations, new applications, and new theory. Specifically, the failure of traditional systems predicated on the individual to observe, replicate, or model what it means to even be the social is at the very heart of the impediment to be conquered and overcome as a prelude to the mathematical physics we explore. As part of this review, we present case studies but with a focus on how an autonomous human system investigated the first self-driving car fatality; how a human-machine team failed to prevent that fatality; and how an autonomous human-machine system might approach the same problem in the future. To advance the science, we reject the aggregation of independence among teammates as a viable scientific approach for teams, and instead explore what we know about a physics of interdependence for an HMS.

The objective of this research is to investigate how much workload is considered ‘good’ for individuals to meet a deadline and successfully complete the assigned task. High work efficiency can be achieved by manipulating workload assignments and assigning them to different individuals at the appropriate time. We have defined the range of this ‘good’ workload as the capacity zone, which should be supported by necessary interventions from computers or human instructors. The capacity zone represents the area between the two workload equilibrium points, whose position and shape are influenced by factors such as mental capacity, maximum efficiency, and stress limit. Our analysis and simulation results indicate that humans are only capable of effectively completing a large amount of workload assignment by the deadline when working within their capacity zone. Therefore, this research aims to enhance overall work efficiency by customising workload allocation strategies based on different individuals' capacity zone and providing timely intervention when they are working beyond their capacity zone.},

	abstract = {Creativity is an important topic in design research. Attempts have been made to develop methods and tools that can help designers become more creative. Yet how and why creativity occurs is still unknown to researchers. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model for creative design. This theoretical model builds on two postulates: 1 design reasoning follows a nonlinear dynamics, which may become chaotic; and 2 there is an inverse U shaped relationship between designer's mental stress and design creativity. In the first postulate, the nonlinear dynamics assumes the form of design governing equation and can be solved by Environment Based Design EBD. The first postulate implies that design reasoning is sensitive to initial conditions, which are defined by the combination of design problem, design solutions, design knowledge, and other design related information. Since the major components in initial conditions may evolve simultaneously and are subject to continuous change during the design process, the design process is highly unpredictable. Some of the unpredictable solutions, which could be of high quality and useful, can be deemed creative. From this first postulate, three paths to creative design are derived, which specify how the initial conditions can be changed. The second postulate states that design creativity occurs when a designer is under a medium mental stress. Mental stresses are positively related to the workload associated with a design problem and negatively related to the designer's mental capacity. The workload is related to the complexity of the design problem and the amount of work in the design process whereas the mental capacity is related to the knowledge and skills required by the design process and to the designer's affect when dealing with the stresses arising from uncertainties and unpredictability of the design dynamics. To show how this theoretical model can be used to study design phenomena, an interpretation of the roles of sketching in design is presented.},

	abstract = {Driver fatigue problem is one of the important factors that cause traffic accidents. Therefore the vision-based driver fatigue detection is the most prospective commercial applications of HCI. However, it is a challenging issue due to a variety of factors such as head and eyes moving fast, external illuminations interference and realistic lighting conditions, etc. This tends to significantly limit its scope of application. In this paper, we present an intelligent vehicle control based on driver fatigue detection. Firstly, the face is located using Haar algorithm and eye location is found with projection technique. After finding eye templates, we propose a new real time eye tracking method based on Unscented Kalman Filter. Thirdly, driver fatigue can be detected whether the eyes are closed over 5 consecutive frames using vertical projection matching. Finally, if driver fatigue is confirmed, the vehicle Cruise Control is start-up with slow speed, and maintains set slow speed such as 5 km/h. The experimental results show that intelligent vehicle control based on driver fatigue detection will be availability in traffic.},

Simple home activities may even be impossible for this group of people. Although much work has been devoted to proposing new assistive technologies to improve the lives of people with disabilities, some studies have found that the abandonment of such technologies is quite high. This work presents a new assistive system based on eye tracking for controlling and monitoring a smart home, based on the Internet of Things, which was developed following concepts of user-centered design and usability. With this system, a person with severe disabilities was able to control everyday equipment in her residence, such as lamps, television, fan, and radio. In addition, her caregiver was able to monitor remotely, by Internet, her use of the system in real time. Additionally, the user interface developed here has some functionalities that allowed improving the usability of the system as a whole. The experiments were divided into two steps. In the first step, the assistive system was assembled in an actual home where tests were conducted with 29 participants without disabilities. In the second step, the system was tested with online monitoring for seven days by a person with severe disability (end-user), in her own home, not only to increase convenience and comfort, but also so that the system could be tested where it would in fact be used. At the end of both steps, all the participants answered the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, which showed that both the group of participants without disabilities and the person with severe disabilities evaluated the assistive system with mean scores of 89.9 and 92.5, respectively.},

With changing lifestyle and work cultures, there is an increase in the risk of stress among the employees. Though many industries and corporates provide mental health related schemes and try to ease the workplace atmosphere, the issue is far from control. In this paper, we would like to apply machine learning techniques to analyze stress patterns in working adults and to narrow down the factors that strongly determine the stress levels. Towards this, data from the OSMI mental health survey 2017 responses of working professionals within the tech-industry was considered. Various Machine Learning techniques were applied to train our model after due data cleaning and preprocessing. The accuracy of the above models was obtained and studied comparatively. Boosting had the highest accuracy among the models implemented. By using Decision Trees, prominent features that influence stress were identified as gender, family history and availability of health benefits in the workplace. With these results, industries can now narrow down their approach to reduce stress and create a much comfortable workplace for their employees.},

The aim is to summarise the main neurophysiological findings related to the measurements of pilot/driver's brain activity during drive performance and how particular aspects of this brain activity could be connected with the important concepts of “mental workload”, “mental fatigue” or “situational awareness”. Review of the literature suggests that exists a coherent sequence of changes for EEG, EOG and HR variables during the transition from normal drive, high mental workload and eventually mental fatigue and drowsiness. In particular, increased EEG power in theta band and a decrease in alpha band occurred in high mental workload. Successively, increased EEG power in theta as well as delta and alpha bands characterise the transition between mental workload and mental fatigue. Drowsiness is also characterised by increased blink rate and decreased HR values. The detection of such mental states is actually performed “offline” with accuracy around 90\% but not online. A discussion on the possible future applications of findings provided by these neurophysiological measurements in order to improve the safety of the vehicles will be also presented.},

	url = {https://eprints.qut.edu.au/64880/},
	abstract = {Digital Human Models (DHM) have been used for over 25 years. They have evolved from simple drawing templates, which are nowadays still used in architecture, to complex and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) integrated design and analysis tools for various ergonomic tasks. DHM are most frequently used for applications in product design and production planning, with many successful implementations documented. DHM from other domains, as for example computer user interfaces, artificial intelligence, training and education, or the entertainment industry show that there is also an ongoing development towards a comprehensive understanding and holistic modeling of human behavior. While the development of DHM for the game sector has seen significant progress in recent years, advances of DHM in the area of ergonomics have been comparatively modest. As a consequence, we need to question if current DHM systems are fit for the design of future mobile work systems. So far it appears that DHM in Ergonomics are rather limited to some traditional applications. According to Dul et al. (2012), future characteristics of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) can be assigned to six main trends: (1) global change of work systems, (2) cultural diversity, (3) ageing, (4) information and communication technology (ICT), (5) enhanced competiveness and the need for innovation, and; (6) sustainability and corporate social responsibility. Based on a literature review, we systematically investigate the capabilities of current ergonomic DHM systems versus the ‘Future of Ergonomics’ requirements. It is found that DHMs already provide broad functionality in support of trends (1) and (2), and more limited options in regards to trend (3). Today’s DHM provide access to a broad range of national and international databases for correct differentiation and characterization of anthropometry for global populations. Some DHM explicitly address social and cultural modeling of groups of people. In comparison, the trends of growing importance of ICT (4), the need for innovation (5) and sustainability (6) are addressed primarily from a hardware-oriented and engineering perspective and not reflected in DHM. This reflects a persistent separation between hardware design (engineering) and software design (information technology) in the view of DHM – a disconnection which needs to be urgently overcome in the era of software defined user interfaces and mobile devices. The design of a mobile ICT-device is discussed to exemplify the need for a comprehensive future DHM solution. Designing such mobile devices requires an approach that includes organizational aspects as well as technical and cognitive ergonomics. Multiple interrelationships between the different aspects result in a challenging setting for future DHM. In conclusion, the ‘Future of Ergonomics’ pose particular challenges for DHM in regards to the design of mobile work systems, and moreover mobile information access.},

One formalized method to study the impact of assisted technologies on the human operator in a safe and non-obtrusive manner is through the use of human performance models (HPMs). HPMs play an integral role when complex human–system designs are proposed, developed, and tested. One HPM tool termed the Man–machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) is a NASA Ames Research Center HPM software tool that has been applied to predict human–system performance in various domains since 1986. MIDAS is a dynamic, integrated HPM environment that facilitates the design, visualization, and computational evaluation of complex man–machine system concepts in simulated operational environments. A range of aviation specific applications including an approach used to model human error for NASA’s Aviation Safety Program, and “what-if” analyses to evaluate flight deck technologies for NextGen operations will be discussed. This chapter will culminate by raising two challenges for the field of predictive HPMs for complex human–system designs that evaluate assisted technologies: that of (1) model transparency and (2) model validation.},

	abstract = {Design is a highly nonlinear chaotic dynamic process with many possible solutions, some of which can be creative. The chaotic nonlinearity of design dynamics triggers mental stresses in designers, whose creativity happens only when their mental stresses are at an optimal level. Following a deductive approach, this paper investigates how knowledge can contribute to designer creativity by uncovering knowledge's (good and bad) roles in the design process, based on which three ways are recommended to use knowledge properly in design. The assumption is that all designs follow one governing equation, which is a recursive integration of three basic design activities: formulation, evaluation and synthesis. The difference between designs of various fields and different kinds (routine, innovative and creative) lies in the range, content, size and nature of the design space in which the design governing equation works. The design governing equation implies a nonlinear chaotic design dynamics, whose solutions are sensitive to its initial conditions and can be routine, innovative or creative. The design governing equation is solved and reformulated by the designer's creativity capability. Therefore, design researchers, practitioners and educators should cohesively look at both designer's knowledge/experience and the designer's creative thinking process.},

Thereafter, existing EEG techniques and methods can be applied to analyse EEG signals related to design. Three application examples are presented at the end of this paper to demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied to analyse design activities.

	abstract = {Many neurocognitive studies endeavor to understand neural mechanisms of basic creative activities in strictly controlled experiments. However, little evidence is available regarding the neural mechanisms of interactions between basic activities underlying creativity in such experiments. Moreover, strictly controlled experiments might limit flexibility/freedom needed for creative exploration. Thus, this study investigated the whole-brain neuronal networks’ interactions between three modes of thinking: idea generation, idea evolution, and evaluation in a loosely controlled creativity experiment. The loosely controlled creativity experiment will provide a degree of flexibility/freedom for participants to incubate creative ideas through extending response time from a few seconds to 3 min. In the experiment, participants accomplished a modified figural Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT-F) while their EEG signals were recorded. During idea generation, a participant was instructed to complete a sketch that was immediately triggered by a sketch stimulus at first sight. During idea evolution, a participant was instructed to complete a sketch that is radically distinctive from what was immediately triggered by the sketch stimulus. During the evaluation, a participant was instructed to evaluate difficulties of thinking and drawing during idea generation and evolution. It is expected that participants would use their experience to intuitively complete a sketch during idea generation while they could use more divergent and imaginative thinking to complete a possible creative sketch during idea evolution. Such an experimental design is named as a loosely controlled creativity experiment, which offers an approach to studying creativity in an ecologically valid manner. The validity of the loosely controlled creativity experiment could be verified through comparing its findings on phenomena that have been effectively studied by validated experimental research. It was found from our experiment that alpha power decreased significantly from rest to the three modes of thinking. These findings are consistent with that from visual creativity research based on event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) and task-related power changes (TRP). Specifically, in the lower alpha band (8–10 Hz), the decreases of alpha power were significantly lower over almost the entire scalp during idea evolution compared to the other modes of thinking. This finding indicated that idea evolution requires less general attention demands than the other two modes of thinking since the lower alpha ERD has been reported as being more likely to reflect general task demands such as attentional processes. In the upper alpha band (10–12 Hz), the decreases of alpha power were significantly higher over central sites during the evaluation compared to idea evolution. This finding indicated that evaluation involves more task-specific demands since the upper alpha ERD has been found as being more likely to reflect task-specific demands such as memory and intelligence, as was defined in the literature. In addition, new findings were obtained since the loosely controlled creativity experiment could activate multiple brain networks to accomplish the tasks involving the three modes of thinking. EEG microstate analysis was used to structure the unstructured EEG data to detect the activation of multiple brain networks. Combined EEG-fMRI and EEG source localization studies have indicated that EEG microstate classes are closely associated with the resting-state network as identified using fMRI. It was found that the default mode network was more active during idea evolution compared to the other two modes of thinking, while the cognitive control network was more active during the evaluation compared to the other two modes of thinking. This finding indicated that idea evolution might be more associated with unconscious and internal directed attention processes. Taken together, the loosely controlled creativity experiment with the support of EEG microstate analysis appears to offer an effective approach to investigating the real-world complex creativity activity.},

	abstract = {Design is a ubiquitous, complex, and open-ended creation behaviour that triggers creativity. The brain dynamics underlying design is unclear, since a design process consists of many basic cognitive behaviours, such as problem understanding, idea generation, idea analysis, idea evaluation, and idea evolution. In this present study, we simulated the design process in a loosely controlled setting, aiming to quantify the design-related cognitive workload and control, identify EEG-defined large-scale brain networks, and uncover their temporal dynamics. The effectiveness of this loosely controlled setting was tested through comparing the results with validated findings available in the literature. Task-related power (TRP) analysis of delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands revealed that idea generation was associated with the highest cognitive workload and lowest cognitive control, compared to other design activities in the experiment, including problem understanding, idea evaluation, and self-rating. EEG microstate analysis supported this finding as microstate class C, being negatively associated with the cognitive control network, was the most prevalent in idea generation. Furthermore, EEG microstate sequence analysis demonstrated that idea generation was consistently associated with the shortest temporal correlation times concerning finite entropy rate, autoinformation function, and Hurst exponent. This finding suggests that during idea generation the interplay of functional brain networks is less restricted and the brain has more degrees of freedom in choosing the next network configuration than during other design activities. Taken together, the TRP and EEG microstate results lead to the conclusion that idea generation is associated with the highest cognitive workload and lowest cognitive control during open-ended creation task.},

To build this model, this paper proposes a methodology based on task analysis. Firstly, it selects the approach and landing scenario of the current two-pilot operations (TCO) and completes the task description of the TCO using the hierarchical task analysis. Secondly, it identifies the function allocation requirements for the transition from TCO to SPO using the work domain analysis and proposes the original function allocation decisions based on the SPO’s system framework. Finally, it creates the predictive mental workload model for evaluating different SPO system design options based on temporal network and multiple resource theory. The researchers use the created model to evaluate the original function allocation decisions and find that the designed SPO system has instantaneous workload values that exceed the upper limit at multiple time points. By analyzing the causes of these problems, the researchers introduce audible warnings and visual indicators to the SPO system to improve design decisions and evaluate these decisions. The results show that the continuous workload profile and overall average workload of the redesigned SPO system are better than the current TCO system, and also prove that the predictive mental workload model can be well applied to evaluate the system design of early SPO.},

The bottom up approach also investigates, how todays multi pilot operations concepts, like the task share of the two pilots, cross-checks or the four-eyes principle are implemented. Based on that, a possible reassignment of actions was made towards enabling single pilot operation with a large airplane supported by an enhanced assistance. The paper describes the research context, current regulations of multi pilot and single pilot operation, related work, the method and an insight to major results.

	abstract = {The high costs of pilot training and remuneration have placed a heavy financial burden on airlines, prompting people to actively study Single Pilot Operations (SPO). Achieving SPO undoubtedly requires the development of the new conceptual framework, and how to reallocate system functions among new agents to obtain optimal system design has become the primary problem in the early stages of the system lifecycle. To solve this problem, this paper applied the Human-centered Design (HCD) approach for the first time to the development and evaluation of SPO in the typical approach and landing scenario. Firstly, the combination of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) was used to identify five function requirements and six function assumptions for the transition from the current Two-crew Operations (TCO) to the future SPO to develop the SPO model. Subsequently, the TCO and SPO models were transformed into two network models to evaluate the result of system function reallocation from the network level and node level using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The network parameters of both levels show that the future SPO developed in this paper has the advantages of better stability, less pilot workload and higher safety than the current TCO.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze human factors related and methodological constraints that prevent the distributed crewing or single pilot operational concept to be pushed forward in commercial aviation. First, it has been argued that alternatives for current commercial flight operations are not necessarily constrained by technology, but by the human factors characteristics of the socio-technical systems enabling these operations. In this paper, we present a constraint analysis of the landing phase of flight (both manual and automatic) using Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA). Given that CWA enables linking constraints related to human and non-human elements of the system and their interactions, CWA supports exploring systemic design solutions for distributed crewing operation. We argue that automatic landing calls for designing for distributed situational awareness, whereas manual landing calls for designing novel human roles in the overall system. Second, distributed crewing concept is being researched by several research groups simultaneously and with various methodologies, including expert interviews, semi-structured task analysis, experiments, policy and historical analysis. In the second half of the paper we argue that successfully progressing towards distributed crewing will require collaboration between research groups and integrating findings obtained with mixed methods. We explore strategies for mixed-method integration in the context of designing distributed crewing operations.},

Advanced artiﬁcial intelligence supporting services and improved communication capabilities are the key enabling technologies that will render future cockpits more integrated with the present digitalized air trafﬁc management system. However, an issue in the integration of such technologies is the lack of socio-technical analysis in the design of these teaming mechanisms.

One solution to this is to reduce the number of pilots in the aircraft and move towards single pilot operations (SPO). However, with this approach, the safety and quality of the ﬂights must be guaranteed. Due to the complex nature of piloting task, a form of human-machine teaming is required to provide extra help and insight to the pilot. To this end, it is natural to look for proper artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) solutions as the ﬁeld has evolved rapidly through the past decades with rise of machine learning and deep learning. The ideal AI for this task should aim to improve the human decisionmaking and focus on interaction with human rather than simply automating processes without human intervention. This particular ﬁeld of AI is designed to communicate with the human and is known as cognitive computing (CC). To this end, several technologies can be employed to cover different aspects of interaction. One such technology is augmented reality (AR) which as of today, has matured enough to be used in commercial products. As such, an experiment was conducted to study the interaction between the pilot and CC teammate, and understand whether assistance is required to enable safe transition towards SPO.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate how a subset of methods from Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) in combination with Social Network Analysis (SNA) can be used to analyse the effects of a reduced crew in a legacy system of a commercial airliner’s two-pilot-crew operations. Whereas existing research approaches have used different methodological approaches such as classical workload evaluations, we focus on social organisation and cooperation at early conceptual design stages. A case study of Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation highlights how Work Domain Analysis, Control Task Analysis and Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis were applied to allocate functions and identify future automation requirements. Furthermore, the SNA shows the possible interactions in future RCO. The effect of technological failure on the network architecture’s resilience is also explored. A proposal on how to react to a data-link outage and break-up in RCO is made with respect to limitations in technology. In this way, the work can foster identifying automation requirements and related possible failures at early stages in the design process.},

	abstract = {Airlines operate in a highly competitive economic environment and hence seek to reduce cost. This thesis examines effects of a proposed reduction of flight crew to one pilot during cruise flight. It is hypothesized that the barrier to implementing Single Pilot Operations is the failure to consider the socio-technical system. Research to date focuses on high workload phases. A literature research reveals that no concept exists that addresses flight phases of low workload and their related
challenges, such as reduced vigilance.
A task analysis was conducted to identify those tasks that pilots execute during the cruise phase. It was assessed that under normal operations, workload is minimal, and pilots keep themselves engaged and thus vigilant through operations-unrelated tasks. An experiment was then designed to estimate vigilance levels during a simulated cruise flight in a realistic, non-laboratory environment. 10 engineering students acted as pilots and executed a 4 hour cruise flight under realistic conditions including communication and check tasks. For comparison, both
Single and Dual Pilot Operation conditions were simulated. Subject’s vigilance was estimated through Psychomotor Vigilance Tasks, subjective assessments, and changes in physiological parameters over time. These include Engagement Indices obtained through Electroencephalogram, concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and heart rate through near infrared spectroscopy, and eye blink frequencies and durations.
Results were inconsistent, as vigilance is very dependent on personal characteristics. Nevertheless, based on 3 physiological parameters, the experiment confirmed that vigilance decreased significantly when no critical events occurred. An objective performance decrement was not detected. With the onset of a simulated critical event, vigilance increased significantly. No significant differences were found in the vigilance decrement between operating regime conditions. It was concluded that
not the crew complement is the underlying cause of the vigilance decrement, but the nature of the cruise phase and lacking opportunities for meaningful engagement.
To close the research gap, a new human centric single pilot concept of
operations was developed. An on-board mission manager is assigned mission management tasks. Mission planning and airline operations support functions keep the mission manager engaged and vigilant during the flight.
Following this thesis, the new concept of operations should be implemented and validated with regards to vigilance levels.},

	abstract = {Safety aspects in general aviation can be a limiting factor to gear toward introducing more single-pilot operations (SPOs), which are currently commonly practised by private pilots of ultralight aircraft, but are also a key to future developments in urban air mobility. The risks of SPOs are mainly due to the lack of redundancy, especially in case of emergeny; the development of reliable onboard companion technology is therefore deemed beneﬁcial. This paper investigates how Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN), and more speciﬁcally the Hierarchical Domain Deﬁnition Language (HDDL), can be used to encode private pilots’ maneuvers. Additionally, challenges are underlined on onboard companion technologies for SPOs, alongside with some features to be derived from hierarchical planning techniques to overcome these challenges.},

	abstract = {The implementation of automation in many domains has led to well-documented accidents and incidents, resulting from reduced situation awareness that occurs when operators are out-of-loop (OOTL), automation confusion, and automation interaction difficulties. Wickens coined the term lumberjack effect to summarize the finding that while automation works well most of the time in typical or normal situations, the performance problems that occur in novel or unexpected situations also increase the likelihood of catastrophic errors. Skraaning and Jamieson have criticized the lumberjack effect due to a study in which they failed to find it. I show that this claim is unsupported due to a number of methodological limitations in their study and conceptual errors. They also provide a model of automation failure that fails to clearly delineate the many barriers to accidents that are available, instead emphasizing the ways in which automation can fail technically and different types of human error. An alternate automation failure model is presented that provides a broader socio-technical perspective emphasizing the design features, processes, capabilities, organizational policies, and training that support people in improving system safety when automation fails.},

The method is presented as a general analytic strategy for providing solutions to initially specified performance problems. The unit of analysis is an operation specified by a goal and activated by an input, attained by an action, and terminated byfeedback. The method is based on the systematic decomposition of goals and subgoals and operations and suboperations to any desired level of detail until the source of performance failure, physical or cognitive, is identified and a solution can be hypothesised. A seven-step procedure is described and illustrated. A variety of uses and adaptations of the method are outlined, including cognitive task design; hazard and operability assessment; training needs in contexts such as power generation, air traffic control, and military command and control tasks. Finally, Hierarchical Task Analysis is realistically evaluated as requiring both time and skill to yield useful results.},

Given this increased demand, will there be enough new pilots to ensure a long-term and continuous supply? The purpose of this research is to examine the supply and demand for US airline pilots. Several new considerations are having an impact on future supply and demand of airline pilots including cost of training, growth, retirement, regulatory changes, and slowing supply of military pilots. The methodology provides an empirical analysis of the pilot labor supply in the US. A multivariate regression model was developed to forecast demand. To explore supply, a variety of data sources have been included and a survey was implemented. The results of the study indicate that the US airline industry will experience a shortage of approximately 35,000 pilots for the 2013 to 2031 time period. The impact of the shortage on regional and major airlines is examined. Possible solutions are discussed.},

A detailed review of these HMI2 evolutions is presented, addressing both manned aircraft (fixed and rotary wing) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) specificities for the most fundamental flight tasks: aviate, navigate, communicate and manage. Due to the large variability in mission requirements, greater emphasis is given to safety-critical displays, command and control functions as well as associated technology developments. Additionally, a top-level definition of RPAS mission-essential functionalities is provided, addressing planning and real-time decision support for single and multi-aircraft operations. While current displays are able to integrate and fuse information from several sources to perform a range of different functions, these displays have limited adaptability. Further development to increase HMI2 adaptiveness has significant potential to enhance the human operator's effectiveness, thereby contributing to safer and more efficient operations. The adaptive HMI2 concepts in the literature contain three common elements. These elements comprise the ability to assess the system and environmental states; the ability to assess the operator states; and the ability to adapt the HMI2 according to the first two elements. While still an emerging area of research, HMI2 adaptation driven by human performance and cognition has the potential to greatly enhance human-machine teaming through varying the system support according to the user's needs. However, one of the outstanding challenges in the design of such adaptive systems is the development of suitable models and algorithms to describe human performance and cognitive states based on real-time sensor measurements. After reviewing the state-of-research in human performance assessment and adaptation techniques, detailed recommendations are provided to support the integration of such techniques in the HMI2 of future Communications, Navigations, Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Avionics (CNS + A) systems.},

	abstract = {Crew Resource Management (CRM) is the application of human factors knowledge and skills to ensure that teams make effective use of all resources. This includes ensuring that pilots bring in opinions of other teammates and utilize their unique capabilities. CRM was originally developed 40 years ago in response to a number of airline accidents in which the crew was found to be at fault. The goal was to improve teamwork among airline cockpit crews. The notion of “team” was later expanded to include cabin crew and ground resources. CRM has also been adopted by other industries, most notably medicine. Automation research now ﬁnds itself faced with similar issues to those faced by aviation 40 years ago: how to create a more robust system by making full use of both the automation and its human operators. With advances in machine intelligence, processing speed and cheap and plentiful memory, automation has advanced to the point that it can and should be treated as a teammate to fully take advantage of its capabilities and contributions to the system. This area of research is known as Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). Research on HAT has identiﬁed reusable patterns that can be applied in a wide range of applications. These patterns include features such as bi-directional communication and working agreements. This paper will explore the synergies between CRM and HAT. We believe that HAT research has much to learn from CRM and that there are beneﬁts to expanding CRM to cover automation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents preliminary results of an evaluation of a Playbook delegation interface for human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in Single Pilot Operations (SPO). In this context, autonomy is defined as a class of automation that acts with more intention and authority, and it behaves more like a team member than a tool. In SPO, there will be a single pilot who will serve as the pilot-in-command (PIC) to make all flight decisions, perform flight tasks, and collaborate with an autonomous teammate during the flight. To enable a move to SPO, an autonomous teammate would share responsibility, authority, and tasks with a human operator to achieve the mission goals. HAT is the study of how to design the functions, interaction, and skills of autonomous teammate to work best with humans as a team. A Playbook interface has been developed as a delegation interface for HAT to support the single pilot during the flights. It allows humans to express their intent to an autonomous teammate to efficiently adapt the function allocation in response to a situation. This may lead to more efficient coordination and joint team performance. The ability to delegate implies that function allocation between teammates can be dynamic and responsive to the current situation. Specifically, in HAT, the challenge in deciding the function allocation prior to and during task execution is how to enable teammates to express their intent to each other quickly and accurately. In SPO, Playbook enables the single pilot to call a template play and modify it with the collaboration of the autonomous teammate. The modification of a play allows not only the changing of task details but also allows changes in allocation between the human and the autonomous teammates. The Playbook evaluation study aims to evaluate (1) the ability of pilots to make function allocation decisions in real-time, and (2) the usability and functionality of the Playbook interface.},

HAT often requires the ability to dynamically allocate functions, and timely methods to accurately express intent to teammates. A Playbook delegation interface was developed to enables the pilot to call and modify plays in collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Twenty pilots evaluated the Playbook interface to explore real-time function allocation, and identified teaming skills needed to support HAT. Pilots preferred the Playbook interface for better collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Interviews revealed that supporting human-like communication in HAT is critical to facilitate decision-making. Four major teaming skills (communication, coordination, cooperation, and cognition) are discussed to support HAT in SPO.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human-machine teaming (HMT) typically combines perspectives from systems engineering, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and human-centered design (HCD), to achieve human systems integration (HSI) through the development of an integrative systems representation that encapsulates human and machine attributes and properties.
OBJECTIVE: The study explores the main factors contributing to performance, trust and collaboration between expert human operators and increasingly autonomous machines, by developing and using the PRODEC method. PRODEC supports HSI by improving the agile HCD of advanced sociotechnical systems at work, which qualify as human-machine teamwork.
METHODS: PRODEC incorporates scenario-based design and human-in-the-loop simulation at design and development time of a sociotechnical system. It is associated with the concept of digital twin. A systemic representation was developed and used, associated with metrics for the evaluation of human-machine teams.
RESULTS: The study is essentially methodological. In practice, PRODEC has been used and validated in the MOHICAN project that dealt with the integration of pilots and virtual assistants onboard advanced ﬁghter aircraft. It enabled the development of appropriate metrics and criteria of performance, trust, collaboration, and tangibility (i.e., issues of complexity, maturity, ﬂexibility, stability, and sustainability), which were associated with the identiﬁcation of emergent functions that help redesign and recalibrate the air combat virtual assistant as well as ﬁghter pilot training.
CONCLUSION: PRODEC addresses the crucial issue of how AI systems could and should inﬂuence requirements and design of sociotechnical systems that support human work, particularly in contexts of high uncertainty. However, PRODEC is still work in progress and advanced visualization techniques and tools are needed to increase physical and ﬁgurative tangibility.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide an overview of concepts of operation for single pilot operations (SPO) and a synthesis of recently published work evaluating these concepts.
Background: Advances in technology have made it possible for a commercial aircraft to be flown by a single pilot under normal conditions, and research is being conducted to examine the feasibility of implementing SPO for commercial aviation.
Method: Context leading up to the consideration of SPO for commercial flight is provided, including the benefits and challenges. Recent studies examining issues relating to automation, operations, and communications in the SPO context are presented.
Results: A number of concepts have been proposed and tested for SPO, and no one concept has been shown to be superior. Single pilots were able to successfully resolve off-nominal scenarios with either the groundsupport or cockpit-automation tools examined. However, the technologies developed in support of these concepts are in prototype forms and need further development.
Conclusion: There have been no obvious “show stoppers” for moving toward SPO. However, the current state of research is in its initial stages, and more research is needed to examine other challenges associated with SPO. Moreover, human factors researchers must continue to be involved in the development of the new tools and technologies to support SPO to ensure their effectiveness. Application: The research issues highlighted in the context of SPO reflect issues that are associated with the process of reducing crew members or providing remote support of operators and, more generally, human interactions with increasingly autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {The current chapter discusses the concepts of human-machine trust and human-machine teaming while presenting data from a qualitative study regarding the antecedents of trust and the components of human-machine teaming. The construct of human-machine trust and the dimensions of teammate-likeness from a human-robot interaction perspective were reviewed. Trust antecedents derived from the literature were used as the basis for coding reasons why individuals reported trust of a technology. The dimensions of human-machine teaming were pulled from a recent conceptual model of teammate-likeness, which formed the basis of a coding scheme used to analyze qualitative data. US workers (N=605) were asked to: (1) identify an intelligent technology that they use on a regular basis, (2) classify the interaction with that technology as a teammate or a tool, (3) report the reasons why they trust or distrust the technology, and (4) explain why they viewed the relationship as one of a teammate (or describe what it would take for the relationship to be viewed as one of a teammate if they reported viewing the technology as a tool). The trust results demonstrated good consistency with the published literature, with the dimensions’ reliability and predictability being paramount. The results regarding human-machine teaming were mostly consistent with an emerging model of teammate-likeness as discussed in the recent literature. Notable divergences were found for individuals who reported the technology as a tool versus as a teammate for the human-machine teaming dimensions but not for the trust factors.},

Participants were invited from industry and from government organizations responsible for design, certification, operation, and accident investigation of transport category, automated aircraft. The goal of the workshop was to clarify the implications of automation, both positive and negative. Workshop panels and working groups identified issues regarding the design, training, and procedural aspects of flight deck automation, as well as the crew's ability to interact and perform effectively with the new technology.

	abstract = {Objective: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible supervisory control via delegation to automation. Background: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance. Method: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to “adaptable”) automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a “level of automation” as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook
              ®
              is described. Results: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team's “playbook.” Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles. Conclusion: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level. Application: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example for uninhabited air vehicle mission planning.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances have made viable the implementation of intelligent automation in advanced tactical aircraft. The use of this technology has given rise to new human factors issues and concerns. Errors in highly automated aircraft have been linked to the adverse effects of automation on the pilot's system awareness, monitoring workload, and ability to revert to manual control. However adaptive automation, or automation that is implemented dynamically in response to changing task demands on the pilot, has been proposed to be superior to systems with fixed, or static automation. This report examines several issues concerning the theory and design of adaptive automation in aviation systems, particularly as applied to advanced tactical aircraft. An analysis of the relative costs and benefits of conventional (static) aviation automation provides the starting point for the development of a theory of adaptive automation. This analysis includes a review of the empirical studies investigating effects of automation on pilot performance. The main concepts of adaptive automation are then introduced, and four major methods for implementing adaptive automation in the advanced cockpit are described and discussed. Aircraft Automation, Pilot Situational Awareness, Aviation Human Factors, Pilot Workload.},

	abstract = {The effects of adaptive task allocation on monitoring for automation failure during multi task flight simulation were examined. Participants monitored an automated engine status task while simultaneously performing tracking and fuel management tasks over three 3D-min sessions. Two methods of adaptive task allocation, both involving temporary return of the automated engine status task to the human operator (“human control”), were examined as a possible countermeasure to monitoring inefficiency. For the model-based adaptive group, the engine status task was allocated to all participants in the middle of the second session for 10 min, following which it was again returned to automation control. The same occurred for the performance-based adaptive group, but only if an individual participant's monitoring performance up to that point did not meet a specified criterion. For the nonadaptive control groups, the engine status task remained automated throughout the experiment. All groups had low probabilities of detection of automation failures for the first 40 min spent with automation. However, following the lO-min intervening period of human control, both adaptive groups detected significantly more automation failures during the subsequent blocks under automation control. The results show that adaptive task allocation can enhance monitoring of automated systems. Both model-based and performance-based allocation improved monitoring of automation. Implications for the design of automated systems are discussed.},

In this study, we introduce a cognitive agent based on the ACT-R cognitive architecture that incorporates an ontological reference model into its declarative memory. The purpose of this is to simulate the performance of critical piloting tasks, such as take-off, in a manner similar to that of a human pilot. The agent accomplishes this by utilizing production rules stored in its procedural memory to deduce knowledge captured and formalized by the ontological reference model stored in its declarative memory. Our findings suggest that this approach is a key step towards developing a cognitive agent that can be tested in a real flight simulator, providing insights into how human pilots function in terms of their cognitive and affective behavior.},

The associated semantics of the ontological languages allow for capturing highly complex domain knowledge. However, the automatic manipulation of knowledge to support the execution of a complex task by humans is a current research issue. This paper presents a solution for interpreting a complex ontological knowledge formalization about aircraft piloting procedures. This specific task is accomplished by human actors where multiple biases may compromise the safe execution. We are developing a solution to support pilots in their tasks’ execution. The domain theory interpretation must allow the reference model’s automatic execution in a complex environment. A reference model of the domain theory has been formalized with ontological language, a task ontology for the execution taxonomy, and a domain ontology containing the knowledge about the execution environment have also been previously developed. In this work, we propose an interpretor capable of manipulating the reference knowledge of the execution taxonomy within a simulation environment. Semantic rules are used to evaluate environmental constraints, task precondition, and execution to allow this automatic manipulation and execution. Once the solution is connected to a simulation environment, a reasoner manipulates the knowledge in order to evaluate the environment and autonomously execute the required tasks. This work is an intermediary step for providing a complete solution for supporting pilots’ execution of reference procedures in a simulation environment.},

A prerequisite for this is the ability to assess the workload of the operator in real-time in an unobtrusive way. We present two Monte Carlo methods for estimating workload of a driver in real-time, based on a driver model developed in a cognitive architecture. The first method that we present is a simple Monte Carlo simulation that gets as input the information that the driver can perceive, but does not take the actions of the driver into account. We evaluate it based on a driving simulator study and compare the workload estimates with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data recorded during the study. Afterwards the shortcomings of the simple approach are discussed and an improved version based on a particle filter is described that takes the driver’s action into account.},

	abstract = {As automation and advanced technologies are introduced into transport systems ranging from the Next Generation Air Transportation System termed NextGen, to the advanced surface vehicle Intelligent Transportations Systems, to future systems designed for space exploration, there is an increased need to validly predict how the future systems will be vulnerable to error given the demands imposed by assisted technologies. One formalized method to study the impact of assisted technologies on the human operator in a safe and non-obtrusive manner is through the use of human performance models (HPMs). HPMs play an integral role when complex human–system designs are proposed, developed, and tested. One HPM tool termed the Man–machine Integration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS) is a NASA Ames Research Center HPM software tool that has been applied to predict human–system performance in various domains since 1986. MIDAS is a dynamic, integrated HPM environment that facilitates the design, visualization, and computational evaluation of complex man–machine system concepts in simulated operational environments. A range of aviation specific applications including an approach used to model human error for NASA’s Aviation Safety Program, and “what-if” analyses to evaluate flight deck technologies for NextGen operations will be discussed. This chapter will culminate by raising two challenges for the field of predictive HPMs for complex human–system designs that evaluate assisted technologies: that of (1) model transparency and (2) model validation.},

	abstract = {Single-pilot operations (SPO), i.e., one pilot on board the flight in charge of all the operations, has received extensive attention in recent years. SPO involves several participants including the pilot, the autopilot, and the ground operator, and it is of great significance to determine the roles of these participants under the SPO mechanism. However, the evaluation of SPO mechanism has received little attention. Aiming at providing a reliable approach for SPO mechanism evaluation under uncertainty, this paper proposes a novel hesitant 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making method based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTS), 2-tuple linguistic information, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS), and VIKOR method to handle the SPO mechanism evaluation problem. Firstly, based on the analysis of SPO, the evaluation criteria system for SPO mechanism is established. Then, considering the uncertain information in the SPO mechanism evaluation process, the HFLTS is used to represent the linguistic judgments of experts under uncertainty. Next, the HFLTSs of different experts are converted into 2-tuple linguistic information and PFSs to model the overall judgments of different criteria. Finally, the extended VIKOR method is adopted to evaluate and rank different SPO mechanisms. A case study of SPO mechanism evaluation for the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, and the SPO mechanism that the autopilot being responsible for GPWS is evaluated by the proposed method to be optimal. Sensitivity and comparison analyses further confirm that the proposed method could provide reliable and reasonable SPO mechanism evaluation results. In conclusion, the proposed method presents a novel and effective way to evaluate and select appropriate SPO mechanisms.},

The method is a variant of a J.C. Flanagan's (1954) critical incident technique extended to include probes that elicit aspects of expertise such as the basis for making perceptual discriminations, conceptual discriminations, typicality judgments, and critical cues. The method has been used to elicit domain knowledge from experienced personnel such as urban and wildland fireground commanders, tank platoon leaders, structural engineers, design engineers, paramedics, and computer programmers. A model of decision-making derived from these investigations is presented as the theoretical background to the methodology. Instruments and procedures for implementing the approach are described. Applications of the method include developing expert systems, evaluating expert systems' performance, identifying training requirements, and investigating basic decision research issues.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The conditions were: baseline (i.e., the existing tool interface), value (where the tool provided a numeric value for the likely success of a particular airport for that aircraft), and logic (where the tool provided the rationale for the recommendation). Trust was highest in the logic condition, which is consistent with prior studies in this area.

An alternative approach to using a large amount of on-board computing proposes the utilisation of extant technology derived from single-seat military aircraft and Uninhabited Air Systems where control is distributed in real time across the aircraft flight deck and ground stations (which supervise several aircraft simultaneously). Using a combination of operational event sequence diagrams and work domain analysis techniques, the allocation of tasks and requirements for the development of supporting technologies for such an operational architecture are identified in a low visibility taxi scenario. These analyses show that many of the functions undertaken by a second pilot in this situation are associated with checking, surveillance and monitoring activities.

In RCO flights, the Captain initially operated the simulated aircraft alone but could request remote crewmember support as off-nominal events occurred and workload was expected to increase. In one of the two RCO conditions, crewmembers were provided with advanced prototype collaboration tools designed to alleviate difficulties in crew coordination. Crews successfully solved all challenging events without accident and analyses of operational performance did not reveal any differences among the three conditions. In RCO flights, crew communication increased when tools were available relative to flights in which they were not; specifically, there were more acknowledgements and decision-making communications.

	abstract = {Objective: The present article undertakes a systematic review of the current state of science for Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) and Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation. Background: SPO/RCO have been investigated with different methods from various disciplines and different organizations to make research progress. The results of federal agencies’, universities’, and EU-projects’ research activities have not been brought together for synthesis yet. Method: We systematically searched for SPO and RCO as independent and fixed search terms retrieving altogether 75 publications on the topic. Exclusion criteria were general and military aviation. Results: Establishing an appropriate function allocation to cope with high workload and off-nominal situations could be achieved by applying a variety of methods and the consideration of advanced automation systems. Their application is required to investigate pilot incapacitation and communication issues further. Data-link and certification issues were acknowledged in principle and have not been solved yet. Conclusion: In sum, experimental studies and modeling techniques of system ergonomics have addressed operational issues very well. Pilot health monitoring systems are less well elaborated than system protection. Future research needs to integrate different research findings and automation technologies. This is necessary to make RCO to a viable and attractive option for commercial development in aviation.

	abstract = {Aeronautical engineering never stopped decreasing the number of technical crewmembers in commercial aircraft since the 1950s. Today, a new challenge has to be taken: single pilot operations (SPO). SPO consist of flying a commercial aircraft with only one technical crewmember in the cockpit, assisted by advanced onboard systems and ground operators providing flying support services. This next move is motivated by cost reduction, and must satisfy the same or better level of safety currently guaranteed with two-crewmen cockpit. This is a human-centered design (HCD) problem where decision-makers have to take risks. This paper presents an approach to risk taking in systems engineering. This approach is illustrated by the presentation of the difficult problem of SPO HCD, and the underlying function allocation problem. 1 Human-Centered Design Institute, Florida Institute of Technology, 150 West University Boulevard, FL 32901, U.S.A gboy@fit.edu},

	abstract = {The high costs of pilot training and remuneration have placed a heavy financial burden on airlines, prompting people to actively study Single Pilot Operations (SPO). Achieving SPO undoubtedly requires the development of the new conceptual framework, and how to reallocate system functions among new agents to obtain optimal system design has become the primary problem in the early stages of the system lifecycle. To solve this problem, this paper applied the Human-centered Design (HCD) approach for the first time to the development and evaluation of SPO in the typical approach and landing scenario. Firstly, the combination of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) was used to identify five function requirements and six function assumptions for the transition from the current Two-crew Operations (TCO) to the future SPO to develop the SPO model. Subsequently, the TCO and SPO models were transformed into two network models to evaluate the result of system function reallocation from the network level and node level using Social Network Analysis (SNA). The network parameters of both levels show that the future SPO developed in this paper has the advantages of better stability, less pilot workload and higher safety than the current TCO.},

	abstract = {Airbus leveraged its presence at the Dubai Airshow to present its first Global Market Forecast (GMF) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
By 2040, Airbus foresees the need for approximately 39,000 new passenger and freighter aircraft, of which 15,250 will replace older and less fuel-efficient aircraft. 
The majority of the demand, or 29,700 new aircraft, will stem from the Small aircraft category that features the A220 and A320 Families. And Latin America is no exception -- with 88 percent of the 2,460 new aircraft required over the next 20 years in the region slated to be made up of Small aircraft. 
Likewise, Airbus projects globally 5,300 new aircraft in the Medium segment, which includes the A321XLR and the A330neo, as well as 4,000 new Large aircraft, such as the A350, will be needed to satisfy demand over the next 20 years. In the region, the Medium and Large categories represent 190 (8 percent) and 100 airplanes (4 percent), respectively.
These aircraft will primarily serve a global passenger market set to grow at 3.9 percent per year thanks to expanding economies and commerce (including tourism) and a rising middle class, who are increasingly likely to fly.
On the cargo side, e-commerce-boosted express freight is expected to grow at 4.7 percent per year while general cargo, representing three quarters of the total market, shows an annual 2.7 percent growth. Consequently, over the next two decades, Airbus foresees a need for 2,440 airplanes for the freighter market, including conversions, while new-build aircraft demand account for 880.
Additionally, the Services market shows an increasing need for commercial aviation services and personnel - some 550,000 new pilots and 710,000 highly skilled technicians will be needed through 2040.

	abstract = {Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace has created many challenges and opportunities for human work. Increased human–automation collaboration is expected on physical or cognitive tasks. Several disciplines have echoed the fact that these new technologies automate part of the work steps in collaboration with human operators rather than replacing entire professions, such as Information Technologies (Seeber et al., 2020), economics (Frey \& Osborne, 2017), work psychology (Parker \& Grote, 2022) and human factors \& ergonomics (Mueller et al., 2021). The area of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is at the forefront of the digitalization of human work wherein AI plays a central role. I4.0 intends to increase production system capabilities in terms of productivity, repeatability, flexibility, real-time monitoring, and process standardization (Zheng et al., 2021). This is done by integrating a set of digital, robotic, and automated technologies into production (Kadir et al., 2019) and combining different digital solutions together (Zheng et al., 2021). The latest technological advances in I4.0 have increased the capabilities of machines in performing complex, cognitive tasks (Xiong et al., 2022). However, the development of I4.0 technologies follows a technocentric approach (Sony \& Naik, 2020). Focusing on technology development first (Carayannis et al., 2022). Bibliometric analyses quantified the technocentric directions of I4.0. A recent literature review noted that out of a sample of 4885 studies with a search strategy that included the terms Industry 4.0 and Human Factors, 4849 studies focused on technical factors and 36 on human factors (Passalacqua et al., 2022). This top-down approach often neglects the contextual factors that govern work systems and their potential integration into situated operational practices (Loup-Escande, 2022).},

	abstract = {Crew Resource Management (CRM) is the application of human factors knowledge and skills to ensure that teams make effective use of all resources. This includes ensuring that pilots bring in opinions of other teammates and utilize their unique capabilities. CRM was originally developed 40 years ago in response to a number of airline accidents in which the crew was found to be at fault. The goal was to improve teamwork among airline cockpit crews. The notion of “team” was later expanded to include cabin crew and ground resources. CRM has also been adopted by other industries, most notably medicine. Automation research now finds itself faced with similar issues to those faced by aviation 40 years ago: how to create a more robust system by making full use of both the automation and its human operators. With advances in machine intelligence, processing speed and cheap and plentiful memory, automation has advanced to the point that it can and should be treated as a teammate to fully take advantage of its capabilities and contributions to the system. This area of research is known as Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT). Research on HAT has identified reusable patterns that can be applied in a wide range of applications. These patterns include features such as bi-directional communication and working agreements. This paper will explore the synergies between CRM and HAT. We believe that HAT research has much to learn from CRM and that there are benefits to expanding CRM to cover automation.},

Enabled through the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, a human-autonomy team (HAT) involves one or more autonomous computerized agents collaborating with humans on interdependent tasks toward the achievement of a common goal. Whereas research on HATs is exploding in recent years, that research has not strongly embraced the vast literature, theory, and methods already developed in the all-human teaming literature. Moreover, definitional and construct validity issues, in terms of what constitutes a HAT, persist in the literature. In the current article we offer construct clarity and we integrate the Input-Mediator-Output model from the high-performance teaming literature to help future researchers classify the variables under study, theorize deeper, and consolidate findings across studies. Both the construct clarity we offer and our theoretical integration will serve as a valuable perspective for contextualizing the studies in the current Special Issue as well as in designing and interpreting future research in the HAT area.},

	abstract = {Automation has entered nearly every aspect of our lives, but it often remains hard to understand. Why is this? Automation is often brittle, requiring constant human oversight to assure it operates as intended. This oversight has become harder as automation has become more complicated. To resolve this problem, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has been proposed. HAT is based on advances in providing automation transparency, a method for giving insight into the reasoning behind automated recommendations and actions, along with advances in human automation communications (e.g., voice). These, in turn, permit more trust in the automation when appropriate, and less when not, allowing a more targeted supervision of automated functions. This paper proposes a framework for HAT, incorporating three key tenets: transparency, bi-directional communication, and operator directed authority. These tenets, along with more capable automation, represent a shift in human-automation relations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible supervisory control via delegation to automation.
BACKGROUND: Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits, including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance, and improved overall performance.
METHOD: We review problems with static and adaptive (as opposed to "adaptable") automation; contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a "level of automation" as a pattern of task-based roles and authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook is described.
RESULTS: On the basis of these analyses, we propose methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the metaphor of a sports team's "playbook." Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of this architecture, with an accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission planning for uninhabited air vehicles.
CONCLUSION: Delegation offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user workload at a manageable level.
APPLICATION: Most applications of adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics, process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable, delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example for uninhabited air vehicle mission planning.},

	abstract = {When designing a joint system for a complex, dynamic, open environment, where the consequences of poor performance by the joint system are potentially grave, the need to shape the machine agents into team players is critical. Traditionally, the assumption has been that if a joint system fails to perform adequately, the cause can be traced to so-called “human error.” However, if one digs a little deeper, they find that the only reason many of these joint systems perform adequately at all is because of the resourcefulness and adaptability that the human agents display in the face of uncommunicative and uncooperative machine agents. The ability of a joint system to perform effectively in the face of difficult problems depends intimately on the ability of the human and machine agents to coordinate and capitalize upon the unique abilities and information to which each agent has access.For automated agents to become team players, there are two fundamental characteristics which need to be designed in from the beginning: observability and directability. In other words, users need to be able to see what the automated agents are doing and what they will do next relative to the state of the process, and users need to be able to re-direct machine activities fluently in instances where they recognize a need to intervene. These two basic capabilities are the keys to fostering a cooperative relationship between the human and machine agents in any joint system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper considers the influence of "Humans and Automation: Use, Misuse, Disuse, Abuse" and examines how it relates to the evolving issue of human-automation interaction.
BACKGROUND: Automation presents important practical challenges that can dramatically affect satisfaction, performance, and safety; philosophical challenges also arise as automation changes the nature of work and human cognition.
METHOD: Papers cited by and citing "Humans and Automation" were reviewed to identify enduring and emerging themes in human-automation research.
RESULTS: "Humans and Automation" emerges as an important node in the network of automation-related papers, citing many and being cited by many recent influential automation-related papers. In their article, Parasuraman and Riley (1997) integrated previous research and identified differing expectations across designers, managers, and operators regarding the need to support operators as a source of automation problems. They also foresaw and inspired research that addresses problems of overreliance and underreliance on automation.
CONCLUSION: This pivotal article and associated research show that even though automation seems to relieve people of tasks, automation requires more, not less, attention to training, interface design, and interaction design. The original article also alludes to the emergence of vicious cycles and dysfunctional meta-control. These problems reflect the coevolution of automation and humans, in which both adapt to the responses of the other.
APPLICATION: Understanding this coevolution has important philosophical implications for the nature of human cognition and practical implications for satisfaction, performance, and safety.},

Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

	abstract = {In the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, the term “autonomy” is generally used to mean the capacity of an artificial agent to operate independently of human guidance. It is thereby assumed that the agent has a fixed goal or “utility function” with respect to which the appropriateness of its actions will be evaluated. From a philosophical perspective, this notion of autonomy seems oddly weak. For, in philosophy, the term is generally used to refer to a stronger capacity, namely the capacity to “give oneself the law,” to decide by oneself what one’s goal or principle of action will be. The predominant view in the literature on the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence is that an artificial agent cannot exhibit such autonomy because it cannot rationally change its own final goal, since changing the final goal is counterproductive with respect to that goal and hence undesirable. The aim of this paper is to challenge this view by showing that it is based on questionable assumptions about the nature of goals and values. I argue that a general AI may very well come to modify its final goal in the course of developing its understanding of the world. This has important implications for how we are to assess the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.},

The level and sophistication of this interaction will only continue to grow in upcoming years, as intelligent technology continues to advance from automation to autonomous capabilities. In this chapter, we provide a historical context on research that has been conducted on humans interacting with machines. Principles of extraordinary human–robotic interaction (EHRI) are outlined to better understand effective and meaningful human–robot interaction. Finally, a discussion regarding the design and development of EHRI is presented. In this section, we present frameworks on how to both study and design EHRI.},

Automation is a multi-dimensional concept, and we propose that Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) automation should be described with reference to the specific system and task that has been automated, the context in which the automation functions, and other relevant dimensions. In this paper, we present definitions of automation, pilot in the loop, pilot on the loop and pilot out of the loop. We further propose that in future, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) RPAS Panel avoids the use of the terms autonomy and autonomous when referring to automated systems on board RPA. Work Group 7 proposes to develop, in consultation with other workgroups, a taxonomy of Levels of Automation for RPAS.},

Though small scale simple tasks can often benefit from automation, this does not necessarily generalize to more complex joint activity. When designing today's more sophisticated systems to work closely with humans, it is important not only to consider the machine's ability to work independently through autonomy, but also its ability to support interdependence with those involved in the joint activity. We posit that to truly improve systems and have them reach their full potential, designing systems that support interdependent activity between participants is the key. Our claim is that increasing autonomy, even in a simple and benign environment, does not always result in an improved system. We will show results from an experiment in which we demonstrate this phenomena and explain why increasing autonomy can sometimes negatively impact performance.},

	abstract = {Designers frequently look toward automation as a way to increase system efficiency and safety by reducing  involvement. This approach can disappoint because the contribution of people often becomes more, not less, important as automation becomes more powerful and prevalent. More powerful automation demands greater attention to its design, supervisory responsibilities, system maintenance, software upgrades, and automation coordination. Developing automation without consideration of the human operator can lead to new and more catastrophic failures. For automation to fulfill its promise, designers must avoid a technology-centered approach that often yields strong but silent forms of automation, and instead adopt an approach that considers the joint operator-automation system that yields more collaborative, communicative forms of automation. Automation-related problems arise because introducing automation changes the type and extent of feedback that operators receive, as well as the nature and structure of tasks. Also, operators’ behavioral, cognitive, and emotional responses to these changes can leave the system vulnerable to failure. No single approach can address all of these challenges because automation is a heterogeneous technology. There are many types and forms of automation and each poses different design challenges. This chapter describes how different types of automation place different demands on operators. It also presents strategies that can help designers achieve promised benefits of automation. The chapter concludes with future challenges in automation design and human interaction with increasingly autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {System safety is of particular importance for many industries. Broadly speaking, it refers to the state or objective of striving to sustainably ensure accident prevention through actions on multiple safety levers (technical, organizational, and regulatory). While complementary to risk analysis, it is distinct in one important way: risk analysis is anticipatory rationality examining the possibility of adverse events (or accident scenarios), and the tools of risk analysis support and in some cases quantify various aspects of this analysis effort. The end-objective of risk analysis is to help identify and prioritize risks, inform risk management, and support risk communication. These tools however do not provide design or operational guidelines and principles for eliminating or mitigating risks. Such considerations fall within the purview of system safety. In this work, we propose a set of five safety principles, which are domain-independent, technologically agnostic, and broadly applicable across industries. While there is a proliferation of detailed safety measures (tactics) in specific areas and industries, a synthesis of high-level safety principles or strategies that are independent of any particular instantiation, and from which specific safety measures can be derived or related to, has pedagogical value and fulfills an important role in safety training and education. Such synthesis effort also supports creativity and technical ingenuity in the workforce for deriving specific safety measures, and for implementing these principles and handling specific local or new risks. Our set of safety principles includes: (1) the fail-safe principle; (2) the safety margins principle; (3) the un-graduated response principle (under which we subsume the traditional “inherently safe design” principle); (4) the defense-in-depth principle; and (5) the observability-in-depth principle. We carefully examine each principle and provide examples that illustrate their use and implementation. We relate these principles to the notions of hazard level, accident sequence, and conditional probabilities of further hazard escalation or advancement of an accident sequence. These principles are a useful addition to the intellectual toolkit of engineers, decision-makers, and anyone interested in safety issues, and they provide helpful guidelines during system design and risk management efforts.},

	abstract = {Rising fuel and operating expenses for commercial airline operators coupled with a predicted pilot labor shortage drives the need for a reduction in costs while continuing to service passengers. One possible solution to reduce recurring costs and mitigate the effects of a pilot shortage is the transition to a single pilot cockpit. Three different design alternatives for implementing a single pilot cockpit in commercial domestic jetliners were identified: the no change option represented by a two pilot cockpit, a single pilot with no additional support, and a single pilot with an onboard support system that automates some of the removed copilot roles. Design alternatives were evaluated using three models: (1) life-cycle cost, (2) reliability, and the (3) processing times for flight procedures based on a human processor simulation. The lifecycle cost model was used to determine the savings generated by a single pilot cockpit. Reliability analysis was done to establish failure rates relative to the target level of safety. A human performance model was developed to evaluate the time on task for each task in the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) for each alternative. The procedure models were decomposed into component tasks and actions required to complete the procedure. The ranking of alternative designs during utility/cost analysis was found to be (1) the no change option, (2) the single pilot with an onboard support system, and (3) the single pilot with no additional support. We found a tradeoff between the two pilot utility and single pilot with onboard support through cost savings. Based on the analysis of results, the single pilot with an onboard support system was judged to have the best chance for becoming a realistic single pilot cockpit system which will reduce recurring airline operating costs, maintain or improve flight safety, and maintain airline serviceability.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective was to examine the relationship between cockpit automation use and task-related and task-unrelated thought among airline pilots.
Background: Studies find that cockpit automation can sometimes relieve pilots of tedious control tasks and afford them more time to think ahead. Paradoxically, automation has also been shown to lead to lesser awareness. These results prompt the question of what pilots think about while using automation.
Method: A total of 18 airline pilots flew a Boeing 747-400 simulator while we recorded which of two levels of automation they used. As they worked, pilots were verbally probed about what they were thinking. Pilots were asked to categorize their thoughts as pertaining to (a) a specific task at hand, (b) higher-level flight-related thoughts (e.g., planning ahead), or (c) thoughts unrelated to the flight. Pilots’ performance was also measured.
Results: Pilots reported a smaller percentage of task-at-hand thoughts (27\% vs. 50\%) and a greater percentage of higher-level flight-related thoughts (56\% vs. 29\%) when using the higher level of automation. However, when all was going according to plan, using either level of automation, pilots also reported a higher percentage of task-unrelated thoughts (21\%) than they did when in the midst of an unsuccessful performance (7\%). Task-unrelated thoughts peaked at 25\% when pilots were not interacting with the automation.
Conclusion: Although cockpit automation may provide pilots with more time to think, it may encourage pilots to reinvest only some of this mental free time in thinking flight-related thoughts.
Application: This research informs the design of human–automation systems that more meaningfully engage the human operator.},

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to review existing research into driver control transitions and to determine the time it takes drivers to resume control from a highly automated vehicle in noncritical scenarios.
Background: Contemporary research has moved from an inclusive design approach to adhering only to mean/median values when designing control transitions in automated driving. Research into control transitions in highly automated driving has focused on urgent scenarios where drivers are given a relatively short time span to respond to a request to resume manual control. We found a paucity in research into more frequent scenarios for control transitions, such as planned exits from highway systems.
Method: Twenty-six drivers drove two scenarios with an automated driving feature activated. Drivers were asked to read a newspaper, or to monitor the system, and to relinquish, or resume, control from the automation when prompted by vehicle systems.
Results: Significantly longer control transition times were found between driving with and without secondary tasks. Control transition times were substantially longer than those reported in the peer-reviewed literature.
Conclusion: We found that drivers take longer to resume control when under no time pressure compared with that reported in the literature. Moreover, we found that drivers occupied by a secondary task exhibit larger variance and slower responses to requests to resume control. Workload scores implied optimal workload.
Application: Intra- and interindividual differences need to be accommodated by vehicle manufacturers and policy makers alike to ensure inclusive design of contemporary systems and safety during control transitions.},

	abstract = {Commercial airlines operate in a highly competitive environment. Flight deck crew cost account for a significant part of total cost, hence airlines try to reduce these cost. One such option is the implementation of Single Pilot Operations (SPO) in commercial aviation. Various organizations have contributed to the discussion of SPO feasibility by developing conceptual frameworks. In this paper, we summarize such efforts on developing future concepts. First, we identified two dominant concept design approaches: second pilot replacement (e.g. through automation) and second pilot displacement (e.g. to the ground). Based on these two design approaches, we have categorized existing concepts in literature into seven concept categories, mainly differing by the number and nature of agents involved. We then review these categories as well as individual concepts along multiple criteria, including safety, and social, economic and legal considerations. We find that concepts involving multiple agents, man and machine, will likely solve some of the human factors issues arising with simply removing the second pilot. Such concepts, however, are inherently complex. Their economic feasibility remains questionable. Besides, more research on how human decision-making contributes to overall safety today, and on how to best support human decision-making in future single pilot concepts must be undertaken. Many questions, predominantly human factors issues, still remain unanswered. We continue by reviewing three general observations on concept development methodology, concept consistency and concept detailedness in literature. Finally, we postulate that SPO will only be implemented with a comprehensive and concise concept that proves to enable operations at least as safe as today. Implementation of SPO will be gradual with less complex concepts in well-defined situations.},

Shared responsibility across air and ground personnel will require highly reliable and secure data communication and supporting automation, which will be safety-critical for passenger and cargo aircraft. This paper looks at the different types and degrees of authority delegation given from the air to the ground and the ramifications of each, including the safety and security hazards introduced, the mitigation mechanisms for these hazards, and other demands on an RCO system architecture which would be highly invasive into (almost) all safety-critical avionics. The adjacent fields of unmanned aerial systems and autonomous ground vehicles are viewed to find problems that RCO may face and related aviation accident scenarios are described. The paper explores possible data communication architectures to meet stringent performance and information security (INFOSEC) requirements of RCO. Subsequently, potential challenges for RCO data communication authentication, encryption and non-repudiation are identified. The approach includes a comprehensive safety-hazard analysis of the RCO system to determine top level INFOSEC requirements for RCO and proposes an option for effective RCO implementation. This paper concludes with questioning the economic viability of RCO in light of the expense of overcoming the operational safety and security hazards it would introduce.},

What decision support will supervisors need to effectively oversee autonomous systems What will their task needs be and how can we support them with usable and useful supervisory human-machine interfaces HMIs and tools Here, we inform the requirements and design of future decision support through a systematic cognitive engineering and analysis process. Structured interviews with 27 unmanned systems experts were carefully sequenced across four groups, with results and artifacts from one group informing the next interviews. Interviews focused on supervisory monitoring and intervention tasks and were designed to feed a user-centered and task-centered, scientifically-principled HMI design process to develop the decision support. The interviews informed this design process by populating three key design artifacts 1 a model of current and future tasks, 2 their allocation across humans and automation, and 3 the necessary supporting human-automation exchanges. A framework for system designers to allocate tasks across humans and automation was extended to provide an objective basis for subject matter experts to contribute their expectations for future automation. The interview results show how todays task needs are not met by current HMIs and tools, and how persisting with them is unlikely to meet the future needs of more nuanced supervisory decision making. Our results inform the design of future supervisory HMIs that target and mitigate todays capability gaps and shed light on how to begin to achieve the DoD vision.},

	abstract = {Function Allocation methods are important for the appropriate allocation of tasks between humans and automated systems. It is proposed that Operational Event Sequence Diagrams (OESDs) provide a simple yet rigorous basis upon which allocation of work can be assessed. This is illustrated with respect to a design concept for a passenger aircraft flown by just a single pilot where the objective is to replace or supplement functions normally undertaken by the second pilot with advanced automation. A scenario-based analysis (take off) was used in which there would normally be considerable demands and interactions with the second pilot. The OESD analyses indicate those tasks that would be suitable for allocation to automated assistance on the flight deck and those tasks that are now redundant in this new configuration (something that other formal Function Allocation approaches cannot identify). Furthermore, OESDs are demonstrated to be an easy to apply and flexible approach to the allocation of function in prospective systems. Practitioner Summary: OESDs provide a simple yet rigorous basis upon which allocation of work can be assessed. The technique can deal with the flexible, dynamic allocation of work and the deletion of functions no longer required. This is illustrated using a novel design concept for a single-crew commercial aircraft.},

	abstract = {Reduced Crew Operations (RCO) are a longstanding concept in academia and slowly reaching into the realm of actual airline operations. However, one of the great barriers is the role definition of the future single pilot. Simply removing one of the pilots will not work - a more comprehensive approach is required. As re-certification of the flight deck will be required anyway, we are offered to unique chance to rethink flight deck operations and properly (re-)consider the role a human operator on the flight deck will perform. Lead by the question if today's pilots are still acting as pilots we present a new role definition for the future RCO flight deck operator. As an introduction, the development of the flight deck and the associated role change of the human operator from being an aviator to a manager of systems is highlighted. Subsequently an overview over existing future flight deck concepts is given, focusing on RCO oriented approaches. The development process through which the herein presented concept was created is stated in the following. First, the underlying technological, operational, and legal assumptions and limitations are summarized. After that the goals to which the concept is supposed to cater are introduced, followed by a description of the utilized development process. Hereafter, the role definition of the human operator is discussed. We envision the human operator to take over a more strategic role than today. Instead of managing individual aircraft systems the operator will be tasked with Total Mission Management (TMM), supported by advanced, more autonomous, automation. Hence, we propose to change the job title of the human operator from pilot to mission manager. A set of typical tasks of the mission manager is described positively (what they are) and negatively (what they are not). Furthermore, the question of responsibility and authority on the flight deck is answered. Eventually, existing challenges and future research efforts regarding the herein proposed concept are discussed.},

In the third of the series of studies investigating the feasibility of ground-supported single pilot operations (SPO) a recommender system was used by 35 airline pilots as an aid for selecting diversionary airports. These pilots, acting as ground operators, used the recommender system from a ground station when off-nominal events required them to provide ground support to a single piloted aircraft. The unique circumstances imposed by each of the scenarios required the ground operators, together with the recommender system, to consider the relative importance of different factors when recommending an airport. Post-trial questionnaires were used to evaluate the recommender system. Results indicated that the pilots did not find the recommender system very transparent and did not always trust its initial recommendation. However, pilots did appear to find the recommender system to be effective in supporting them with the high workload in off nominal situations, and interactions with the system appear to have been satisfactory. Pilots also reported in post simulation surveys a desire to have better explanations for those recommendations. Findings will inform the development of future iterations of the recommender system, as well as influence SPO procedures and further development of a prototype ground station.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study examines whether the pilot flying’s (PF) scanning behavior is affected by the absence of the pilot monitoring (PM) and aims at deriving implications for the design of single-pilot cockpits for commercial aviation.
Background
Due to technological progress, a crew reduction from two-crew to single-pilot operations (SPO) might be feasible. This requires a redesign of the cockpit to support the pilot adequately, especially during high workload phases such as approach and landing. In these phases, the continuous scanning of flight parameters is of particular importance.
Method
Experienced pilots flew various approach and landing scenarios with or without the support of the PM in a fixed-base Airbus A320 simulator. A within-subject design was used and eye-tracking data were collected to analyze scanning behavior.
Results
The results confirm that the absence of the PM affects the PF’s scanning behavior. Participants spent significantly more time scanning secondary instruments at the expense of primary instruments when flying alone. Moreover, the frequency of transitions between the cockpit instruments and the external view increased while mean dwell durations on the external view decreased.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that the PM supports the PF to achieve efficient scanning behavior. Information should be presented differently in commercial SPO to compensate for the PM’s absence and to avoid visual overload.
Application
This research will help inform the design of commercial SPO flight decks providing adequate support for the pilot particularly in terms of efficient scanning behavior.},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, pilot-oriented mobile applications have seen widespread adoption among recreational pilots. Pilots have reported they provide significant workload savings by eliminating the need to manage paper charts, manuals, and checklists in the cockpit. The pilot, nonetheless, still must go looking for the information when it is required, increasing accident risk by diverting attention away from control of the aircraft. In this paper, we provide an overview of a cognitive assistant that determines when information is required based on flight context and automatically provides it to the pilot at the appropriate time. In addition to an overview of the concept, a recent evaluation is discussed alongside future plans to evaluate the safety of the Digital Copilot.},

	abstract = {The Tasking Interface Manager (TIM) seeks to demonstrate real-time adaptive automation and real-time task, interface and timeline management to support pilot operations in the Cognitive Cockpit . The intended TIM application is to enable the pilot to concentrate his/her cognitive capabilities on the tactical aspects of the mission and off-load the routine activities to automation. Ideally, this would allow the pilot to remain in a feed-forward activity (supervisory control), whilst most, if not all feedback requirements are met by decision aiding and automation. The TIM utilises output from the Situation Assessment Support System and the Cognition Monitor to adaptively present information and adaptively automate tasks according to the situational context and the pilot’s internal state. The main features of a tasking interface are a shared mental model, the ability to track goals, plans and tasks, and the ability to communicate intent about the mission plan. The paper will describe the concept of operation and the technical development of the TIM.},

However, while automation may take on some tasks previously performed by humans, humans will still be required to remain in the system for the foreseeable future. The collaboration between humans and these increasingly autonomous systems will begin to resemble cooperation between teammates, rather than simple task allocation. It is critical to understand this human-autonomy teaming (HAT) to optimize these systems in the future. One methodology to understand HAT is by identifying recurring patterns of HAT that have similar characteristics and solutions.

As part of an ongoing project to develop a framework for human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in aviation, a study was conducted to evaluate proposed tenets of HAT. Participants performed a flight-following task at a ground station both with and without HAT features enabled. Overall, participants preferred the ground station with HAT features enabled over the station without the HAT features. Participants reported that the HAT displays and automation were preferred for keeping up with operationally important issues. Additionally, participants reported that the HAT displays and automation provided enough situation awareness to complete the task, reduced the necessary workload and were efficient. Overall, there was general agreement that HAT features supported teaming with the automation. These results will be used to refine and expand our proposed framework for human-autonomy teaming.},

This distinction has been highlighted in recent literature, and theoretical reasons why the psychological experience of humans interacting with autonomy may vary and affect subsequent collaboration outcomes are beginning to emerge (de Visser, Pak, \& Shaw, 2018; Wynne \& Lyons, 2018). In this review, we do a deep dive into human-autonomy teams (HATs) by explaining the differences between automation and autonomy and by reviewing the domain of human-human teaming to make inferences for HATs. We examine the domain of human-human teaming to extrapolate a few core factors that could have relevance for HATs. Notably, these factors involve critical social elements within teams that are central (as argued in this review) for HATs. We conclude by highlighting some research gaps that researchers should strive toward answering, which will ultimately facilitate a more nuanced and complete understanding of HATs in a variety of real-world contexts.},

Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions.BackgroundWhereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human?autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human?autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective.MethodWe searched the literature on human?autonomy teaming. To meet our criteria for inclusion, the paper needed to involve empirical research and meet our definition of human?autonomy teaming. We found 76 articles that met our criteria for inclusion.ResultsWe report on research environments and we find that the key independent variables involve autonomous agent characteristics, team composition, task characteristics, human individual differences, training, and communication. We identify themes for each of these and discuss the future research needs.ConclusionThere are areas where research findings are clear and consistent, but there are many opportunities for future research. Particularly important will be research that identifies mechanisms linking team input to team output variables.},

This situation has led to inappropriate expectation for design and misdirected criticism of design methods. The situation is not new and has origins in historical human factors research. I differentiate the concepts of automation and autonomy with a new framework of agents. The framework is complemented by observations on characteristics of automated vs. autonomous systems, identification of error and failure modes, and formulation of a matrix of design constraints dictating possible applications of each type of agent. Discussion is provided on levels of automation, which have also been criticized in the literature, along with coverage of types of autonomy. A definition of autonomy is mutated throughout the paper to a form with utility for engineering. In general, demands of automated agents on the human-task-environment system should be absent from design of autonomous agents and design of automated systems is always automation-centric despite best efforts at human-centred approaches. Key requirements of design for autonomy include: agent viability in a target context, agent self-governance in goal formulation and fulfilment of roles, and independence in defined tasks performance.},

This is attributed to a possible loss of skills and of situation awareness (SA) arising from vigilance and complacency problems, a shift from active to passive information processing, and change in feedback provided to the operator. We studied the automation of a navigation task using an expert system and demonstrated that low SA corresponded with out-of-the-loop performance decrements in decision time following a failure of the expert system. Level of operator control in interacting with automation is a major factor in moderating this loss of SA. Results indicated that the shift from active to passive processing was most likely responsible for decreased SA under automated conditions.},

	abstract = {One main hurdle towards commercial airliners’ Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) is how to encounter pilot incapacitation. The aim of this modelling study is to evaluate the potential effects of a single-pilot’s incapacitation on a future design approach to RCO. Most solutions propose a ground support of the pilot by a remote operator whom control should be handed over in case of an emergency. Both incapacitation and homicide-suicide have been discussed in the literature but neither of these events have been modelled nor evaluated empirically. We introduce a future operational design concept for RCO which includes a remote-copilot as ground support and automation tools monitoring pilot’s health and entries into aircraft systems. The hazard analysis technique System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was used to model and analyse scenarios of incapacitation/homicide-suicide. A hierarchical control structure showed how RCO can be embedded into commercial aviation. The STPA of pilot incapacitation and two scenarios of pilot homicide-suicide showed how unsafe control actions leading to an incident or accident after incapacitation/homicide-suicide could be prevented. The possible detection and take-over of control by the ground support in the case of incapacitation raised the question for detailed procedures on how to react to its detection. Either an autoland by the remote-copilot or by an affiliated system is possible. An additional breakup of data-link may only be solved by an automatic landing system on-board.},

	abstract = {History has shown that a larger flight crew does not per se imply that aircraft operations will be safer. The goal of this thesis is to determine the technical hurdles to Single Pilot Commercial Operations (SPCO). Continued technological developments, the upsurge of commercial Unmanned Aerial Systems, the non-negligible cost of air crews, and yet, stagnation in commercial crew reductions since 1980 are reasons to clarify the current technical hurdles to SPCO. The research was initiated with a broad literature survey. It was found that advances in technology and human factors understanding have made each historical crew reduction possible, through a redistribution of tasks across (fewer) humans, automation, supporting infrastructure and accompanying procedures. An exhaustive list was then formulated of all issues that could potentially affect a reduction to SPCO. Consequently, in-depth research of each issue determined the most predominant challenges to SPCO are; a. providing the single pilot with the correct situational awareness at a manageable workload; b. ensuring adequate monitoring of pilot performance without an on-board human co-pilot; and c. ensuring redundancy in case of incapacitation. Finally, Single Pilot Incapacitation Redundancy (SPIR) solutions were explored by means of a scenario analysis and functional analysis. The greatest challenge to SPIR turns out to be the setting of the incapacitation detection sensitivity threshold; avoiding excessive false warnings (alarm problem) yet retaining immediacy for timely recovery of stable flight; both incapacitation detection and seem-less control take-over are tasks more suited to the adaptability of humans. A concept for a SPCO flight deck has been presented in which these issues become obsolete.},

To better understand the socio-technical system we model alternative single pilot operations using Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) and analyse those models using Social Network Analysis (SNA). Four potential models of single pilot operations were compared to existing two pilot operations. Using SOCA-CAT from CWA, we were able to identify the potential functional loading and interactions between networks of agents. The interactions formed the basis on the SNA. These analyses potentially form the basis for distributed system architecture for the operation of a future aircraft. The findings from the models suggest that distributed crewing option could be at least as resilient, in network architecture terms, as the current dual crewing operations.},

The current study examined how important it was for ground-based personnel providing support to single piloted aircraft (ground operators) to have opportunities to acquire situation awareness (SA) prior to being called on to assist an aircraft. We looked at two distinct concepts of operation, which varied in how much information was available to ground operators prior to being called on to assist a critical event (no vs. some Situation Preview). Thirty-five commercial pilots participated in the current study. Results suggested that a ground operators’ lack of initial SA when called on for dedicated assistance is not an issue, at least when the ground operator station displays environmental and systems data which are important to gaining overall SA of the specified aircraft. With appropriate displays, ground operators were able to provide immediate assistance, even if they had minimal SA prior to getting a request.},

	abstract = {Within human factors there is burgeoning interest in the “human-autonomy teaming” (HAT) concept as a way to address the challenges of interacting with complex, increasingly autonomous systems. The HAT concept comes out of an aspiration to interact with increasingly autonomous systems as a team member, rather than simply use automation as a tool. The authors, and others, have proposed core tenets for HAT that include bi-directional communication, automation and system transparency, and advanced coordination between human and automated teammates via predefined, dynamic task sequences known as “plays.” It is believed that, with proper implementation, HAT should foster appropriate teamwork, thus increasing trust and reliance on the system, which in turn will reduce workload, increase situation awareness, and improve performance. To this end, HAT has been demonstrated and/or studied in multiple applications including search and rescue operations, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, photography, and aviation. The current paper presents one such effort to apply HAT. It details the design of a HAT agent, developed by Human Automation Teaming Solutions, Inc., to facilitate teamwork between the automation and the human operator of an advanced ground dispatch station. This dispatch station was developed to support a NASA project investigating a concept called Reduced Crew Operations (RCO); consequently, we have named the agent R-HATS. Part of the RCO concept involves a ground operator providing enhanced support to a large number of aircraft with a single pilot on the flight deck. When assisted by R-HATS, operators can monitor and support or manage a large number of aircraft and use plays to respond in real-time to complicated, workload-intensive events (e.g., an airport closure). A play is a plan that encapsulates goals, tasks, and a task allocation strategy appropriate for a particular situation. In the current implementation, when a play is initiated by a user, R-HATS determines what tasks need to be completed and has the ability to autonomously execute them (e.g., determining diversion options and uplinking new routes to aircraft) when it is safe and appropriate. R-HATS has been designed to both support end users and researchers in RCO and HAT. Additionally, R-HATS and its underlying architecture were developed with generaliz ability in mind as a modular software applicable outside of RCO/aviation domains. This paper will also discuss future further development and testing of R-HATS.},

In the third of the series of studies investigating the feasibility of ground-supported single pilot operations (SPO) a recommender system was used by 35 airline pilots as an aid for selecting diversionary airports. These pilots, acting as ground operators, used the recommender system from a ground station when off-nominal events required them to provide ground support to a single piloted aircraft. The unique circumstances imposed by each of the scenarios required the ground operators, together with the recommender system, to consider the relative importance of different factors when recommending an airport. Post-trial questionnaires were used to evaluate the recommender system. Results indicated that the pilots did not find the recommender system very transparent and did not always trust its initial recommendation. However, pilots did appear to find the recommender system to be effective in supporting them with the high workload in off nominal situations, and interactions with the system appear to have been satisfactory. Pilots also reported in post simulation surveys a desire to have better explanations for those recommendations. Findings will inform the development of future iterations of the recommender system, as well as influence SPO procedures and further development of a prototype ground station.},

In particular, an analysis regarding the use of the Microsoft HoloLens as a guidance device and co-pilot compensation, to perform useful and timely alerts based on airline emergency procedures. The augmented reality (AR) device was introduced to raise the ability to handle complex work flows under time pressure by adding artificial visual guidance to the crew member. The goal was to enhance situation awareness and confidence taking carefully time critical decisions without the support of a second crew member. The test scenario included an engine fire in a single cockpit operation environment during cruise flight. For the survey, 24 experienced and type rated active Airbus A320 pilots have been compared in two groups to each other using an Airbus A320 fix based simulator. Within the test scenario, the reaction time initiating the standardized action items (based on Airbus A320 quick reference handbook) have been recorded. The first group had only support by the airplane-side systems (e.g. ECAM display), while the second group used the AR-glasses. Compared to the conventional airplane-side systems support to deal with engine fire situations, direct visual instructions have been given by the AR-glasses and have been always linked to a displayed three-dimensional visual marker. This should immediately inform the pilot where the focus of attention must be on and thus ensure that the actions are carried out more quickly. By guiding the pilot through visual instructions, manual scanning of the cockpit parameters have been unnecessary. The direct instructions in the glasses and the additional information expected to shorten the reaction time. At the same time this should relieved the pilot and reduce the workload in order to get a more efficient human machine system and enhanced situation awareness.},

	abstract = {Considering the foreseen expansion of the air transportation system within the next two decades and the opportunities offered by higher levels of automation, Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) are regarded as viable alternatives to conventional two-pilot operations for commercial transport aircraft. In comparison with current operations, SPO require higher cognitive efforts, which potentially result in increased human error rates. This article proposes a novel Cognitive Pilot-Aircraft Interface (CPAI) concept, which introduces adaptive knowledge-based system functionalities to assist single pilots in the accomplishment of mission-essential and safety-critical tasks in modern commercial transport aircraft. The proposed CPAI system implementation is based on real-time detection of the pilot’s physiological and cognitive states, allowing the avoidance of pilot errors and supporting enhanced synergies between the human and the avionics systems. These synergies yield significant improvements in the overall performance and safety levels. A CPAI working process consisting of sensing, estimation and reconfiguration steps is developed to support the assessment of physiological and external conditions, a dynamic allocation of tasks and adaptive alerting. Suitable mathematical models are introduced to estimate the mental demand associated to each piloting task and to assess the pilot cognitive states. Suitably implemented decision logics allow a continuous and optimal adjustment of the automation levels as a function of the estimated cognitive states. Representative numerical simulation test cases provide a preliminary validation of the CPAI concept. In particular, the continuous adaptation of the flight deck's automation successfully maintains the pilot's task load within an optimal range, mitigating the onset of hazardous fatigue levels. It is anticipated that by including suitably designed Psychophysiological-Based Integrity Augmentation (PBIA) functionalities the CPAI system will allow to fulfil the evolving aircraft certification requirements and hence support the implementation of SPO in commercial transport aircraft.},

No data currently exists that quantifies the contribution of the flight crew in this role. Neither does data exist for how often the flight crew handles non-normal procedures or system failures on a daily basis in the National Airspace System. A pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study was conducted by the NASA Langley Research Center in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate the pilot's contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Eighteen crews flew various normal and non-normal procedures over a two-day period and their actions were recorded in response to failures. To quantify the human's contribution, crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. Pilot actions and performance when one of the flight crew was impaired were also recorded for comparison against the nominal two-crew operations.

	abstract = {Future reduced crew operations or even single pilot operations for commercial airline and on-demand mobility applications are an active area of research. These changes would reduce the human element and thus, threaten the precept that “a well-trained and well-qualified pilot is the critical center point of aircraft systems safety and an integral safety component of the entire commercial aviation system.” NASA recently completed a pilot-in-the-loop high fidelity motion simulation study in partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) attempting to quantify the pilot's contribution to flight safety during normal flight and in response to aircraft system failures. Crew complement was used as the experiment independent variable in a between-subjects design. These data show significant increases in workload for single pilot operations, compared to two-crew, with subjective assessments of safety and performance being significantly degraded as well. Nonetheless, in all cases, the pilots were able to overcome the failure mode effects in all crew configurations. These data reflect current-day flight deck equipage and help identify the technologies that may improve two-crew operations and/or possibly enable future reduced crew and/or single pilot operations.},

	abstract = {Global air transport demand is increasing steadily, with the global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) growing at an annual rate of 4\% [1] and the number of passengers rising at an average annual rate of 10.6\% [2]. By the end of 2016, it is estimated that 1,420 large commercial airliners will be produced, 40.5\% more than was produced five years ago [2]. A consequence of this growth is an exacerbation of the existing global shortage of qualified pilots. Airlines have to hire more than 500,000 new commercial pilots until 2034 in order to meet this unprecedented air transport demand [3]. Additionally, the high costs associated with training and remuneration of pilots has been a substantial economic burden on air carriers, prompting active research into the concept of single-pilot operations (SPO) as an option for the future evolution of commercial airliners. SPO cockpits have already been developed for military fighters as well as general aviation (GA) aircraft, with small business jets like the Cessna Citation I obtaining approval for SPO as early as 1977 [4], however, the last decade has seen considerable interest in the implementation of SPO in commercial aviation. NASA has been conducting SPO-related studies since the mid-2000s [5], [6], while some recent research in Europe has focused on the technical [7] and operational [8] challenges of SPO. In the SPO concept of operations (Figure 1), a single pilot operates the flight deck with increased ground support from a dedicated ground human flight crew. The ground operators (GO) fulfil a role similar to that of a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) operator, providing a combination of strategic and tactical support to the single pilot in collaboration with the air traffic controllers (ATCo).},

In this paper, starting from Dual-Pilot Operations (DPO), the piloting process, decision-making process and decision-making mode of DPO for commercial aircraft are studied to obtain the operational requirements of SPO. Then, based on above analysis, the operational mechanism of SPO is studied and the core technology of SPO mode is proposed. Next, a new closed frequent bicluster mining algorithm named FsCluster is proposed for the optimization of the SPO model, and the other efficient bicluster mining algorithm named TsCluster is proposed for the analysis and verification of the SPO model. Finally, a typical flight phase scenario is modelled by Magic System of System, and combined with the proposed algorithms for analysis and verification to determine whether the SPO mode can meet the DPO requirements.},

Design/methodology/approach - From a review of the literature it is suggested that some of the functions of the non-flying pilot would be better assumed by either onboard automation or ground-based systems. Findings - It is argued that the design of the flight deck and the role of the pilot require re-conceptualising to accommodate the requirements for flying a highly automated aircraft single-handed. With such re-design, considerable efficiency gains will be achieved, but to fully realise these gains a system-wide approach is required which extends beyond the design of the aircraft per se. Research limitations/implications - This is only a high-level thought piece to stimulate debate. Much greater consideration of all the issues raised is required, as is a change in regulatory requirements. Practical implications - If implemented, the single crew aircraft could result in a revolution in air transport, offering considerable cost savings, especially on shorter routes with relatively small passenger loads. Originality/value - A first attempt to use human factors as a design driver to produce operational and economic efficiency by the novel use of existing technologies spun-out from other areas of aircraft development.},

We review approaches to function allocation in the context of human machine teaming with technology that exhibits high levels of autonomy (e.g., unmanned aerial systems). Although most function allocation projects documented in the literature have employed a single method, we advocate for an integrated approach that leverages four key activities: (1) analyzing operational demands and work requirements; (2) exploring alternative distribution of work across person and machine agents that make up a human machine team (HMT); (3) examining interdependencies between human and autonomous technologies required for effective HMT performance under routine and off-nominal (unexpected) conditions; and (4) exploring the trade-space of alternative HMT options. Our literature review identified methods to support each of these activities. In combination, they enable system designers to uncover, explore, and weigh a range of critical design considerations beyond those emphasized by the MABA–MABA (“Men are better at, Machines are better at”) and Levels of Automation function allocation traditions. Example applications are used to illustrate the value of these methods to design of HMT that includes autonomous machine agents.},

While human teams have been extensively studied in the psychological and training literature, and agent teams have been investigated in the artificial intelligence research community, the commitment to research in HMT is relatively new and fueled by several technological advances such as electrophysiological sensors, cognitive modeling, machine learning, and adaptive/adaptable human-machine systems. This paper presents an architectural framework for investigating HMT options in various simulated operational contexts including responding to systemic failures and external disruptions. The paper specifically discusses new and novel roles for machines made possible by new technology and offers key insights into adaptive human-machine teams. Landed aircraft perimeter security is used as an illustrative example of an adaptive cyber-physical-human system (CPHS). This example is used to illuminate the use of the HMT framework in identifying the different human and machine roles involved in this scenario. The framework is domain-independent and can be applied to both defense and civilian adaptive HMT. The paper concludes with recommendations for advancing the state-of-the-art in HMT.},

To explore in advance the problems that the introduction of SPO into the aviation system would bring, the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach has been widely used in the development of SPO. A systematic review of the progress of HCD approach in SPO research can promote further development of SPO. In this paper, the literature resources of SPO were firstly retrieved from scientific research databases by subject search and were used as the input of scientometric analysis to obtain the highly cited literature, the number of annual publications, and the co-authorship network, which enables readers to understand the research trends and research groups of current SPO. Secondly, the development, application, and research process of the HCD approach were introduced in detail, and the progress of the HCD approach in SPO research was reviewed systematically from three aspects: concept design, function allocation, and system evaluation. Finally, limitations of current SPO research and future research directions for applying the HCD approach to SPO were also discussed.},

	abstract = {The advent of very compact, very powerful digital computers has made it possible to automate a great many processes that formerly required large, complex machinery. Digital computers have made possible revolutionary changes in industry, commerce, and transportation. This book, an expansion and revision of the author's earlier technical papers on this subject, describes the development of automation in aircraft and in the aviation system, its likely evolution in the future, and the effects that these technologies have had -- and will have -- on the human operators and managers of the system. It suggests concepts that may be able to enhance human-machine relationships in future systems. The author focuses on the ability of human operators to work cooperatively with the constellation of machines they command and control, because it is the interactions among these system elements that result in the system's success or failure, whether in aviation or elsewhere.  Aviation automation has provided great social and technological benefits, but these benefits have not come without cost. In recent years, new problems in aircraft have emerged due to failures in the human-machine relationship. These incidents and accidents have motivated this inquiry into aviation automation. Similar problems in the air traffic management system are predicted as it becomes more fully automated. In particular, incidents and accidents have occurred which suggest that the principle problems with today's aviation automation are associated with its complexity, coupling, autonomy, and opacity. These problems are not unique to aviation; they exist in other highly dynamic domains as well. The author suggests that a different approach to automation -- called "human-centered automation" -- offers potential benefits for system performance by enabling a more cooperative human-machine relationship in the control and management of aircraft and air traffic.},

Improving pilot performance first lies in defining the role of the pilot—why a human is needed in the first place. The next step is allocating functions based on the needs of that role (rather than fitness), and then using automation to target specific human weaknesses in performing that role. Examples are provided (some of which could be implemented in conventional cockpits now).

From improved information systems such as the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), to increased control of the aircraft (e.g., automated collision avoidance maneuvering) and onwards to overall management of flights (via the Flight Management System, FMS), pilots now have a range of high-tech systems at their fingertips. This technology is designed to support pilots in maintaining situation awareness, making complex decisions, communicating effectively and assisting in flying the aircraft. However, each technological advancement comes with human computer interaction (HCI) considerations that warrant exploration. This special issue aims to bring together new knowledge and best practices, from the scientific community and industry, related to HCI issues on the modern flight deck. The goal of the special issue is to shed light on areas in need of improvement and potential new solutions for maintaining effective HCI on the flight deck. The articles within this special issue incorporate quantitative and qualitative research methods along with HCI design techniques to examine current and future use of technology on the flight deck and how it impacts pilot performance. Although this issue represents a small portion of the challenges pilots face when interacting with technology on the modern flight deck, it will hopefully serve as a lens to focus attention on the many HCI issues that pilots face, the progress that has been made to date, and the many areas that show potential for improvement.},

However, while technological progress has continued, there have been no further reductions in crew complement, largely because the two pilots mitigate each other’s failures (both mistakes and incapacitation). We present a conceptual framework under which we believe a reduction in crew complement could be made while maintaining current levels of safety. Under this framework, much of the monitoring and verification would fall upon automation. Ground personnel performing an enhanced flight following role would aid the remaining pilot in assessment of any off-nominal event. Additionally, in particularly high-workload or risky situations, a ground pilot could step into the role of first officer. We then discuss four human-in-the-loop simulations conducted at NASA Ames Research Center that illustrate key aspects of this conceptual framework and informed key aspects of its development.},

Method: Context leading up to the consideration of SPO for commercial flight is provided, including the benefits and challenges. Recent studies examining issues relating to automation, operations, and communications in the SPO context are presented.
Results: A number of concepts have been proposed and tested for SPO, and no one concept has been shown to be superior. Single pilots were able to successfully resolve off-nominal scenarios with either the ground-support or cockpit-automation tools examined. However, the technologies developed in support of these concepts are in prototype forms and need further development.
Conclusion: There have been no obvious “show stoppers” for moving toward SPO. However, the current state of research is in its initial stages, and more research is needed to examine other challenges associated with SPO. Moreover, human factors researchers must continue to be involved in the development of the new tools and technologies to support SPO to ensure their effectiveness.
Application: The research issues highlighted in the context of SPO reflect issues that are associated with the process of reducing crew members or providing remote support of operators and, more generally, human interactions with increasingly autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {Considering the foreseen expansion of the air transportation system within the next two decades and the opportunities offered by higher levels of automation, Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) are regarded as viable alternatives to conventional two-pilot operations for commercial transport aircraft. In comparison with current operations, SPO require higher cognitive efforts, which potentially result in increased human error rates. This article proposes a novel Cognitive Pilot-Aircraft Interface (CPAI) concept, which introduces adaptive knowledge-based system functionalities to assist single pilots in the accomplishment of mission-essential and safety-critical tasks in modern commercial transport aircraft. The proposed CPAI system implementation is based on real-time detection of the pilot’s physiological and cognitive states, allowing the avoidance of pilot errors and supporting enhanced synergies between the human and the avionics systems. These synergies yield significant improvements in the overall performance and safety levels. A CPAI working process consisting of sensing, estimation and reconfiguration steps is developed to support the assessment of physiological and external conditions, a dynamic allocation of tasks and adaptive alerting. Suitable mathematical models are introduced to estimate the mental demand associated to each piloting task and to assess the pilot cognitive states. Suitably implemented decision logics allow a continuous and optimal adjustment of the automation levels as a function of the estimated cognitive states. Representative numerical simulation test cases provide a preliminary validation of the CPAI concept. In particular, the continuous adaptation of the flight deck's automation successfully maintains the pilot's task load within an optimal range, mitigating the onset of hazardous fatigue levels. It is anticipated that by including suitably designed Psychophysiological-Based Integrity Augmentation (PBIA) functionalities the CPAI system will allow to fulfil the evolving aircraft certification requirements and hence support the implementation of SPO in commercial transport aircraft.},

In SPO, a single pilot makes flight decisions, performs flight tasks, and collaborates with an autonomous teammate. The autonomous teammate shares responsibility, authority, and tasks. Challenges include the design of functions, interactions, and teaming skills. HAT often requires the ability to dynamically allocate functions, and timely methods to accurately express intent to teammates. A Playbook delegation interface was developed to enables the pilot to call and modify plays in collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Twenty pilots evaluated the Playbook interface to explore real-time function allocation, and identified teaming skills needed to support HAT. Pilots preferred the Playbook interface for better collaboration with the autonomous teammate. Interviews revealed that supporting human-like communication in HAT is critical to facilitate decision-making. Four major teaming skills (communication, coordination, cooperation, and cognition) are discussed to support HAT in SPO.},

This GOC applies to two-flight crew operations, intentional and unintentional flight-crew reduction and total flight-crew incapacitation, and comprises different solutions that cover all safety-related crew duties across all phases of flight and serves as an interface between technology and organisations. The GOC concept was developed under the Advanced Cockpit for Reduction of Stress and Workload (ACROSS) project, which was part of the European Commission’s 7th Framework Programme (FP7) and investigated four solutions that will contribute to the reduction of pilot workload and stress by adapting cockpit applications and systems to challenging situations.},

The concept was evaluated through a number of evaluation activities, including two simulation campaigns. The results suggest that the concept could be a robust proposal to address single pilot incapacitation, and no major showstoppers have been identified from an operational, legal, and regulatory point of view.

Using the ISO 9241-411 multidirectional selection task (a 2D Fitts’ task), we quantified the impact of vibration on touchscreen target selection throughput (a performance score combining both speed and accuracy) and error rate in a cockpit layout. 24 participants completed the task under 2 vibration levels (helicopter level flight versus static), 2 hand support methods (using the thumb, while holding onto the screen’s edge, versus using the index finger freehand), 4 touchscreen types (two avionic and two consumer touchscreens), 2 touchscreen positions (main instrument panel versus pedestal), and 4 target sizes (0.8, 1, 1.5 and 2 cm). We found average throughput values of 6.5 bits per second (bps) in static conditions, versus 5.7 bps under vibration, and average error rates of 10.3\% in static conditions, versus 16.6\% under vibration. Similar to prior work, we found an exponential increase in error rate with decreasing target size. Larger target sizes helped mitigate the impact of vibration. We did not find evidence of a benefit to anchoring the hand on the touchscreen’s bezel edge, compared to the freehand baseline, under vibration or static conditions. Under vibration, the pedestal outperformed the main instrument panel position, with higher throughput and lower error rate. In static conditions, the two positions performed similarly. This work contributes to vibration mitigation methods when interacting with touchscreens in the aviation context.},

	abstract = {Due to their customizability, touchscreens continue to advance as a device of choice when designing aircraft cockpits. Previous studies investigated the effect of turbulence on human performance when using touchscreens, but few have evaluated its performance for realistic aviation-specific tasks. In this study, we compared four touchscreen widgets and three mechanical devices during realistic data input on a primary flight display (PFD). Twenty participants took part in the experiment at a constant level of vibration, while simultaneously completing a secondary tracking task. Results indicated that virtual keypads lead to faster completion time for medium to large changes while keeping error rates low. Rotary knobs were fastest for small changes. Virtual keypads also had lower workload and discomfort compared to rotary knobs and drag-based widgets. We found the completion time to be the most important factor in tracking task performance, which translated in higher precision for keypads. These findings suggest that virtual keypads represent an efficient and secure option for numerical data input at low-to-medium vibration.},

A systematic review of the progress of HCD approach in SPO research can promote further development of SPO. In this paper, the literature resources of SPO were firstly retrieved from scientific research databases by subject search and were used as the input of scientometric analysis to obtain the highly cited literature, the number of annual publications, and the co-authorship network, which enables readers to understand the research trends and research groups of current SPO. Secondly, the development, application, and research process of the HCD approach were introduced in detail, and the progress of the HCD approach in SPO research was reviewed systematically from three aspects: concept design, function allocation, and system evaluation. Finally, limitations of current SPO research and future research directions for applying the HCD approach to SPO were also discussed.},

Subject Guide: Ergonomics and Human Factors

This book is an attempt to better formalize a systemic approach to human–systems integration (HSI). Good HSI is a matter of maturity… it takes time to mature. It takes time for a human being to become autonomous, and then mature! HSI is a matter of human–machine teaming, where human–machine cooperation and coordination are crucial. We cannot think engineering design without considering people and organizations that go with it. We also cannot think new technology, new organizations, and new jobs without considering change management.
More specifically, this book is a follow-up of previous contributions in human-centered design and practice in the development of virtual prototypes that requires progressive operational tangibility toward HSI. The book discusses flexibility in design and operations, tangibility of software-intensive systems, virtual human-centered design, increasingly autonomous complex systems, human factors and ergonomics of sociotechnical systems, systems integration, and changed management in digital organizations. 
The book will be of interest to industry, academia, those involved with systems engineering, human factors, and the broader public.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the evolution of human-centered design (HCD) in aerospace systems over the last forty years. Human factors and ergonomics first shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of human–computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital interaction design and user experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the point that complex system design and management found itself center stage, with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups. Today, human systems integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent problem, but a multi-agent research field. Systems are systems of systems, considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e. in their constant redesign). This chapter will more specifically focus on human factors such as human-centered systemic representations, life-critical systems, organizational issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility, tangibility, and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.},

This review considers the economic, technological, regulatory (safety) and societal acceptance of the single-pilot airliner, and examines some of the operational challenges that airlines may face.

Such services require an adaptive context-aware integration of technical functionalities with the concurrent tasks that a pilot must deal with. Advanced artiﬁcial intelligence supporting services and improved communication capabilities are the key enabling technologies that will render future cockpits more integrated with the present digitalized air trafﬁc management system. However, an issue in the integration of such technologies is the lack of socio-technical analysis in the design of these teaming mechanisms. A key factor in determining how and when a service support should be provided is the dynamic evolution of pilot workload. This paper investigates how the socio-technical model-based systems engineering approach paves the way for the design of a digital assistant framework by formalizing this workload. The model was validated in an Airbus A-320 cockpit simulator, and the results conﬁrmed the degraded pilot behavioral model and the performance impact according to different contextual ﬂight deck information.

	abstract = {The advent of very compact, very powerful digital computers has made it possible to automate a great many processes that formerly required large, complex machinery. Digital computers have made possible revolutionary changes in industry, commerce, and transportation. This book, an expansion and revision of the author's earlier technical papers on this subject, describes the development of automation in aircraft and in the aviation system, its likely evolution in the future, and the effects that these technologies have had -- and will have -- on the human operators and managers of the system. It suggests concepts that may be able to enhance human-machine relationships in future systems. The author focuses on the ability of human operators to work cooperatively with the constellation of machines they command and control, because it is the interactions among these system elements that result in the system's success or failure, whether in aviation or elsewhere.  Aviation automation has provided great social and technological benefits, but these benefits have not come without cost. In recent years, new problems in aircraft have emerged due to failures in the human-machine relationship. These incidents and accidents have motivated this inquiry into aviation automation. Similar problems in the air traffic management system are predicted as it becomes more fully automated. In particular, incidents and accidents have occurred which suggest that the principle problems with today's aviation automation are associated with its complexity, coupling, autonomy, and opacity. These problems are not unique to aviation; they exist in other highly dynamic domains as well. The author suggests that a different approach to automation -- called "human-centered automation" -- offers potential benefits for system performance by enabling a more cooperative human-machine relationship in the control and management of aircraft and air traffic.},

	shorttitle = {Aviation {Economics}},
	url = {https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/aysps_dissertations/41},
	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays on aviation. The first chapter investigates the relationship between competition and airline safety. The U.S. airline industry transports almost a billion passengers a year. Accidents still cause much apprehension and angst among the public; the two 737 Max crashes are the latest examples. Despite massive improvements in safety over the last decades which are largely due to technological improvements, there is still a lack of research done on the effect of market conditions. We provide a simple theoretical model to explain the relationship between safety and competition. Using data from 1995 to 2018, we employ a negative binomial regression to evaluate the impact of competition through the Inverse Herfindahl Hirschman Index, Concentration Ratio 4 and 8, on injury outcome of passengers involved in an airline accident. Since accidents are costly both directly and indirectly through brand image deterioration, a competitive market may incentive airlines to reduce risks of accidents. Meanwhile, since safety is unobserved by passengers, under a highly competitive environment where profit margins are thinner, airlines cut costs, some of which are related to safety. Our result suggests that a less competitive industry has a positive impact on safety, suggesting that excess profits are in part reinvested into safety measures.  
The second chapter tests the hypothesis that monopsony power is an important determinant of wages and employment in the U.S. pilot labor market. We estimate the labor supply curve of the U.S. airline industry using firm-level employment and accident data from 1995 to 2018. Utilizing a labor demand instrument, the prevalence of aircraft accidents, allows us to directly measure monopsony power. We also investigate the effects of competition, as measured by the Inverse Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, on the labor supply elasticity. We estimate a labor supply elasticity of 2.56, indicating that airlines have substantial monopsony power in pilot hiring, resulting in a labor shortage and wages 28.11\% below the marginal revenue products. We also find that as market competition rises, airlines slightly lose market power in hiring: wages increase as competition increases. The source of monopsony power lies elsewhere, mostly in the training and career structure, which we address and provide policy recommendations.  
The third chapter proposes a new method to calculate the p-values of a treatment variable in a cross-sectional small sample. Causal evaluation is becoming increasingly popular in industry and government. In small sample scenarios inference is more difficult. This often occur for several reasons such as budget constraints or noncompliance, but also in phenomena with low frequency. Small samples complicate causal evaluations for at least three reasons: (i) they are associated with greater sampling error, (ii) p-values based on standard tests are not trustworthy and the statistical power of these tests can be too low to detect significant program effects, (iii) the validity of parameter inference strongly depends on distributional assumptions. This paper proposes a simple approximation for the p-values to use in the regression analysis of treatment effects models with normal or nonnormal error distributions. The approximation is derived from recent developments in likelihood analysis and has a third-order distributional accuracy. Thus, for very small or medium-sized samples, the proposed method has remarkably higher accuracy compared to traditional ones that usually rely on normality or large samples. The method is then applied to aviation data to evaluate the impact of accidents on airfares, which is relevant to both airlines and insurance companies.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study examines low-, medium-, and high-performing Human-Autonomy Teams’ (HATs’) communication strategies during various technological failures that impact routine communication strategies to adapt to the task environment.
Background
Teams must adapt their communication strategies during dynamic tasks, where more successful teams make more substantial adaptations. Adaptations in communication strategies may explain how successful HATs overcome technological failures. Further, technological failures of variable severity may alter communication strategies of HATs at different performance levels in their attempts to overcome each failure.
Method
HATs in a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System-Synthetic Task Environment (RPAS-STE), involving three team members, were tasked with photographing targets. Each triad had two randomly assigned participants in navigator and photographer roles, teaming with an experimenter who simulated an AI pilot in a Wizard of Oz paradigm. Teams encountered two different technological failures, automation and autonomy, where autonomy failures were more challenging to overcome.
Results
High-performing HATs calibrated their communication strategy to the complexity of the different failures better than medium- and low-performing teams. Further, HATs adjusted their communication strategies over time. Finally, only the most severe failures required teams to increase the efficiency of their communication.
Conclusion
HAT effectiveness under degraded conditions depends on the type of communication strategies enacted by the team. Previous findings from studies of all-human teams apply here; however, novel results suggest information requests are particularly important to HAT success during failures.
Application
Understanding the communication strategies of HATs under degraded conditions can inform training protocols to help HATs overcome failures.},

	abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is characterized by strategies aimed towards process, product, and service improvement through technology interconnectivity, decision-making speed, and automation capacity. These strategies, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a central role, emphasize technological advancement to drastically improve performance-related factors in operational environments. However, their development follows a technocentric approach neglecting their profound impacts on human work. For the anticipated benefits of technological advancement to materialize, it is necessary to consider social and organizational factors (e.g., trust calibration, work redesign) in addition to technical factors. In this chapter, we present HUMan-centred AI for Industry 5.0
(HUMAI5.0) as an evolution of the current industrial revolution. It is an innovative 6-step framework to support the development of AI systems that promote human long-term well-being, engagement, and system performance within complex socio-technical environments. HUMAI5.0 builds upon established human factors and ergonomics practices, organizational psychology, and our own experiences working with AI-based technologies. We applied this framework to two use cases in industrial context: error detection in manufacturing and quality control in aircraft maintenance. We were able to develop future work environments that leveraged the best abilities of both parties (human and AI) in a way respectful of the workers. Artifacts of this framework were also helpful to offer a common ground to various stakeholders to understand the potential impacts AI has in their workplace and how best to address it.},

Current capabilities and maturity of virtual prototyping and human-in-the-loop simulation (HITLS) enable virtual human-centered design (HCD) that can be combined with SE to realize HSI. HSI is almost necessarily model-based; it uses HITLS and requires a homogenized human and machine systemic representation. Virtual HCD enables us to take into account both human and organizational elements not only during the design process but also during the whole life cycle of a system. These new capabilities are made possible by digital tools that enable virtual environments that in turn should be made tangible. Digital twins can be solutions for supporting HSI, operations performance, and experience integration. Tangibility is therefore a crucial concept in model-based HSI (MBHSI), which should be both analytical and experimental, based on appropriate scenarios and performance metrics essentially supported by domain experience. An aeronautical example illustrates an instance of MBHSI.},

	title = {Understanding {Human}-{Autonomy} {Teaming} through {Interdependence} {Analysis}},
	abstract = {As any craftsman knows, having the right tool for the job makes all the difference. Sadly, adequate formative tools are lacking for the design of human-autonomy teaming. Most existing tools focus on the taskwork, in particular physical activity. More advanced efforts extend this with consideration for cognitive activity. While these traditional task-based approaches are important, they do not sufficiently capture human-machine teaming requirements. The key to understanding human-autonomy teaming, and in fact teaming in general, is understanding interdependence. This paper proposes several design principles to help designers reorient their minds and view the problem space through the lens of interdependence. The paper then discusses a design and analysis tool called the Interdependence Analysis tool. This tool’s purpose is to understand how people and automation can effectively team by providing insight into the interdependence relationships used to support one another throughout an activity. This tool helps recognize both the human factors and the technological factors that enhance or inhibit effective teaming. As such, it can be used to derive both algorithmic and interface implementation requirements. The goal of interdependence analysis is improving the guidance provided to designers building human–machine systems in order to achieve more effective teaming. As we build more intelligent machines to tackle more sophisticated challenges, designers need formative tools for creating effective teaming. The Interdependence Analysis tool meets this need, explicitly modelling the machine, the human, the work and the interplay of all three.},

The book brings together a series of CWA applications and discussions from world-leading human factors researchers and practitioners. It begins with an overview of the CWA framework, including its theoretical underpinnings, the methodological approaches involved (including practical guidance on each phase), and previous applications of the framework. The core of the book is a series of CWA applications, undertaken in a wide range of safety critical domains for a range of purposes. These serve to demonstrate the contribution that CWA can make to real-world projects and provide readers with inspiration for how such analyses can be practically carried out. Following this, a series of applications in which new approaches or adaptations have been added to the framework are presented. These show how practical applications feedback into the theories/approaches underpinning CWA. The closing chapter then speculates on future applications of the framework and on a series of new research directions required in order to enhance its utility.  In emphasising the practical realities of performing CWA, and the real-world impacts it can provide, the book tackles several common misconceptions in a constructive and persuasive way. It provides a welcome demonstration of how CWA can be a powerful ally in tackling complexity-related problems that afflict systems in all areas.},

In this paper, two studies are presented in which a range of handover strategies are tested. The anticipated driver strategies were modeled using OESDs to serve as predictions of driver behavior. Drivers were then observed in two separate studies: (1) using a Lower-Fidelity (vehicle seat and controls) simulator and (2) using a Higher-Fidelity (whole vehicle) simulator. Driver behavior during a takeover task was categorized according to the signal detection paradigm into hits, misses, false alarms, and correct rejections. The results showed that for all strategies in both sets of studies, the median criterion for validity was exceeded ( {\textgreater} 0.8), suggesting that OESDs made good predictions of driver behavior during the handover of the vehicle from automation to manual control.},

	abstract = {In parallel with the rise of naturalistic decision theory, cognitive science and human–computer interaction (HCI) researchers were developing increasingly powerful analysis methods that collectively were called cognitive task analysis techniques. The purpose of these techniques was to analyze and model the cognitive processes that gave rise to human task performance in specific domains, as the basis for design and evaluation of computer-based systems and their user interfaces. The US Navy's Tactical Decision Making Under Stress (TADMUS) project provided an opportunity for these avenues of research to come together. This chapter discusses both the method for and the results of detailed cognitive analysis and modeling in complex, tactical domains considered by the TADMUS program. The chapter begins with a set of logical requirements for the cognitive analysis process and then describes a framework, called COGNET (Cognition as a Network of Tasks), used to meet those requirements. The remainder of the chapter presents the cognitive analysis of tactical decision processes that was conducted in the TADMUS research, in the form of the COGNET model that resulted from the analysis. Applications of the model are discussed in the conclusion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although seemingly counterintuitive, the more intelligent the technological system, the greater the need for collaborative skills. This paper will argue why teaming intelligence is important to AI, provide a general structure for AI researchers to use in developing intelligent systems that team well, assess the current state of the art and, in doing so, suggest a path forward for future AI systems. This is not a call to develop a new capability, but rather, an approach to what AI capabilities should be built, and how, so as to imbue intelligent systems with teaming competence.},

Prior research has postulated that 6 facets of autonomous agent teammate-likeness (AAT) are the key factors in shaping teaming perceptions of technology. Using a narrative approach, participants (N = 300) viewed one of two descriptions created to characterize a high or low teaming technology. Following the narrative, participants responded to psychosocial scales aiming to assess teaming perceptions, commitment to the technology, and the 6 facets of AAT. Results demonstrated that all of the scales were reliable, and all but one scale was reported as higher in the high-teaming narrative condition, as expected. Unexpectedly, there were no differences in the interdependence scale between the two narrative conditions. Using linear regression, the current study also examined the unique relationships between the AAT facets and both teaming perceptions and commitment to the technology. For teaming perceptions, interdependence (higher), synchrony (lower), and team focus (higher) were uniquely related to teaming perceptions. For commitment to the technology, communication richness, interdependence, and team focus were all uniquely related to higher commitment. Implications for the human-machine teams are discussed herein.},

We predict an improvement in task efficiency and fluency compared to a purely reactive process. We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's fluency and success. By way of explanation, we propose a number of fluency metrics that differ significantly between the two study groups.},

	abstract = {The study of human-robot interaction is fundamental to the design and use of robotics in real-world applications. Robots will need to predict and adapt to the actions of human collaborators in order to achieve good performance and improve safety and end-user adoption. This paper evaluates a human-robot collaboration scheme that combines the task allocation and motion levels of reasoning: the robotic agent uses Bayesian inference to predict the next goal of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference and dynamic task planning signiﬁcantly improves both objective and perceived performance of the humanrobot team. Participants were highly sensitive to the differences between robot behaviors, preferring to work with a robot that adapted to their actions over one that did not.},

Amongst this burgeoning wave of untrammelled automation there is now beginning to arise a cadre of ever-more independent, autonomous systems.

Here, I advocate for human-centred and human favouring constraints to be designed, programmed, promulgated and imposed upon these nascent forms of independent entity. I am not sanguine about the collective response of modern society to this call. Nevertheless, the warning must be voiced and the issue debated, especially among those who most look to mediate between people and technology.

	abstract = {Future operations envisioned in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) involve more complex and precise operations, more available information for the flight crew and air traffic control, more highly automated and complex systems, and increased flight crew tasks and responsibilities. A major issue of the NextGen concept of operations, particularly in a super density terminal area, is the potential brittleness of the system to disruptions and the reduced potential for humans to supply the needed resilience for non-normal and off-nominal operations. To mitigate these potential NextGen issues, it is necessary to identify the functions of a critical element of future aviation systems—aircraft flight decks, and to allocate those functions among the automated and human components of the flight deck. Two competing flight deck design concepts were developed based on different directions that flight deck designs may take in the future because of unpredictable forces and factors. The first design path embodies pilot roles and responsibilities that represent the “pilot as pilot,” and the second design path embodies roles and responsibilities that represent the “pilot as manager.” The two flight deck concepts were developed from an analysis of the anticipated operational requirements of the NextGen environment, emphasizing requirements that are likely to have significant impact on flight deck and flight crew functions and responsibilities. The two design concepts were used to generate high level human factors flight deck design guidelines that apply to both design paths in a future “NextGen” air traffic environment, focusing on those that are new or different from traditional human factors flight deck design guidelines.},

Whereas existing research approaches have used different methodological approaches such as classical workload evaluations, we focus on social organisation and cooperation at early conceptual design stages. A case study of Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation highlights how Work Domain Analysis, Control Task Analysis and Social Organization and Cooperation Analysis were applied to allocate functions and identify future automation requirements. Furthermore, the SNA shows the possible interactions in future RCO. The effect of technological failure on the network architecture’s resilience is also explored. A proposal on how to react to a data-link outage and break-up in RCO is made with respect to limitations in technology. In this way, the work can foster identifying automation requirements and related possible failures at early stages in the design process.},

	abstract = {Different operational concepts for Single-Pilot and Reduced-Crew Operations (RCO) in commercial aviation include a ground based supportive component of a remote-copilot. The impact of an outage and break-up of the data-link connecting air and ground has not been investigated yet. Social Network Analysis (SNA) in combination with a Cognitive Work Analysis was used to compare the three crewing options of multi-crew, reduced-crew and a break-up of data-link in RCO in terms of social factors and interactions. A data-link loss decreased the networks density and its resilience to any off-nominal and emergency situations. The single-pilot suffers from higher functional loadings, is located more central and processes a higher information flow. A twofold degraded operational procedure was proposed to mitigate an outage and loss of data-link in combination with additional automation tools onboard. Nonetheless, further research is required to provide a data-link with a big bandwidth as reliable and secure as possible.},

	abstract = {Commercial aviation is expected to see an average growth of 3.7\% per year over the next five years. At the same time, regional airlines are expressing concerns that they are unable to find a sufficient number of pilots who meet the minimum number of required flight hours and certifications. One option for handling the increased demand for, and reduced supply of, pilots is to better distribute the pilots already employed. This could be accomplished by reducing the number of required crewmembers on the flight deck from two to one. However, a significant challenge to the implementation of a single pilot crew is the increase in workload a single pilot would face especially in complex airspace. The harbor pilot is one concept of operations that has been proposed to deal with the potentially serious problem. In this concept, the harbor pilot is a ground operator whose job it is to help arriving single pilot aircraft navigate the complex terminal area airspace. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of the harbor pilot concept by measuring the workload and performance of harbor pilots during a series of back-to-back simulated arrival procedures. Preliminary results show that harbor pilots rate their workload generally low and indicate that the maximum consecutive normal approaches that they are able to complete in a row is about four to six, provided they are not emergency situations.},

However, reliance on such technical systems is crucial for their widespread applicability and acceptance. The societal tools to express reliance are usually formalized by lawful regulations, i.e., standards, norms, accreditations, and certificates. Therefore, the T{\textbackslash}"UV AUSTRIA Group in cooperation with the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, proposes a certification process and an audit catalog for Machine Learning applications. We are convinced that our approach can serve as the foundation for the certification of applications that use Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the techniques that drive the current revolution in Artificial Intelligence. While certain high-risk areas, such as fully autonomous robots in workspaces shared with humans, are still some time away from certification, we aim to cover low-risk applications with our certification procedure. Our holistic approach attempts to analyze Machine Learning applications from multiple perspectives to evaluate and verify the aspects of secure software development, functional requirements, data quality, data protection, and ethics. Inspired by existing work, we introduce four criticality levels to map the criticality of a Machine Learning application regarding the impact of its decisions on people, environment, and organizations. Currently, the audit catalog can be applied to low-risk applications within the scope of supervised learning as commonly encountered in industry. Guided by field experience, scientific developments, and market demands, the audit catalog will be extended and modified accordingly.},

It is critical to understand this human-autonomy teaming (HAT) to optimize these systems in the future. One methodology to understand HAT is by identifying recurring patterns of HAT that have similar characteristics and solutions.

Based on analyses of key technologies and these technologies’ technical readiness levels, a cobweb evaluation model as a universal evaluation model has been used to evaluate unmanned systems. If the technology warps (aspects of autonomy) and wefts (levels of those aspects) of unmanned systems can be determined for the cobweb model, the model can handle the mutual coupling, high dimensions, and diversity of warp lines.

We also discuss some consequences of various AI/ML modes used by LW, on the utility of the HAT design approaches. Ways of using these HAT designs in a complementary way are suggested to support coordination through both plan and feedback, such as by integrating external and internal feedback in prediction of future action. We illustrate our suggestions through a use case, which provide additional nuance to our theoretical discussion.

The function analysis employed 'bottom up' and 'top down' analyses and demonstrated the comparability of identified functions, using the 'lift off' segment of the 'take off' phase as a test case. The normal flight mission and selected contingencies were addressed. Two alternative methods for using the functional description in the allocation of functions between man and machine were investigated. The two methods were compared in order to ascertain their relative strengths and weaknesses. Finally, conclusions were drawn regarding the practical utility of function analysis methods.},

	abstract = {With advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive modelling, unmanned aircraft are expected to act as human-like wingmen in the near future. For fluent and effective manned–unmanned teaming, synthetic wingmen must be able to account for and adapt to their partners’ intent with little or no communication. To enable such abilities, it becomes crucial to identify the requirements that makes intent explainable to synthetic wingmen, necessitating approaches to describe and analyse intent from a human-centric perspective. To address this issue, this paper reports on findings from using Work Domain Analysis to design and analyse models of situated intent with six levels of cognitive control (frames, effects, values, generic, implementations, and physical). Through a literature review and seven subject matter expert interviews, a synthesized model was designed to represent fighter pilots’ intent in a manned–unmanned teaming scenario. Using the synthesized model as the context, a transfer of control and a link loss situation were further described and analysed. Experiences show that Work Domain Analysis can provide a practical and applicable means to model situated intent, particularly since designed models can be re-utilised to model intent in similar situations. Furthermore, the model analyses show the importance of accounting for fighter pilots’ adopted frames since small variations of the framing of the situations can propagate throughout the model resulting in conflicting or inconsistent intent. The paper concludes that synthetic wingmen must be able to reason about all six levels of cognitive control, requiring a more holistic approach to make intent explainable. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the past few years, Reduced Crew Operations (RCO) represent an inevitable as an unavoidable development for the aviation industry, and as such a major challenge for pilots and airlines. It is justified for us, researchers, to address the potential shortcomings of such a development. Over the course of their professional life, pilots might face incapacitation, which may be temporary or permanent, partial or total, coming from cognitive overload, stress, loss of situational awareness (SA), or anything else impairing their ability to carry out their missions. Up to now, the risk of pilots' occupational incapacity has been addressed by the presence of a copilot in the cockpit, able to take over if necessary. Following this reduction in aircrew, the next step is placing a pilot alone onboard to manage the activities of the crew (case of Single Pilot Operation). It is thus fundamental to design a virtual assistant in order to support the capacity of efficient and relevant knowledge transfer. It is therefore necessary to be able to transfer knowledge of the context to a pilot replacing the one in a state of incapacitation.Since our study is rather explorative, the authors could not cover a whole flight mission. Therefore, this study focused on the landing phase. We placed particularly emphasis in our research on the study of the pilot's cognitive models such as SA, operational strategy and decision-making. We investigated the inherent behavioral elements to design a decision model adapted to the variability of the pilot's profiles. Afterwards, we designed a test bench and presented a use case to eighteen pilots from different companies with a representative set of individuality. For this purpose, we placed those pilots in a flight simulation during a complex scenario involving an aircraft failure during a landing phase with bad weather. At the end of the scenario, we asked pilots to go through their experience in the simulator to understand their situation awareness. These situation awareness requirements gave us clues with regard to the pilot's perception of salient information about the cockpit environment, and the context associated with the situation.This explorative study highlighted the need for understanding how pilots share their knowledge to another pilot. By doing so, we aim to develop a generic methodology of selection of the useful and necessary information to share with an operator in a complex situation. © 2022 IEEE.},

They suggest that the latter category be excluded from classes of automation failures. They then proceed to identify important factors within each category. This paper presents a complementary taxonomy designed to identify factors contributing to automation-related failures in order to develop probes to elicit predictions of failure stories for some proposed new system design from a range of experts. While there is overlap between these two taxonomies, there are important differences. It is suggested that they could be integrated or used jointly both for knowledge elicitation and to identify requirements regarding needed capabilities of predictive performance models.},

In the current work, we demonstrate a pilot model that can perform and simulate taxiing and takeoff tasks. The model was built in Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought Rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture and can be connected to flight simulators such as X-Plane to generate various data, including performance, mental workload, and situation awareness. The model results are determined in combination by the declarative knowledge chunks, production rules, and a set of parameters. Currently, the model can generate flight operation behavior similar to human pilots. We will collect human pilot data to examine further and validate model assumptions and parameter values. Once validated, such models can support interface evaluation and competency-based pilot training, providing a theory-based predictive approach complementary to human-in-the-loop experiments for aviation research and development. © 2021 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

With a single pilot commanding the UAVs while piloting their aircraft, operators may find it challenging to manage all systems should the system design not be conducive to a steady state level of workload. To understand the potential effects of manned-unmanned teaming on the pilot's cognitive workload, an Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT) workload model was developed. The model predicts pilot workload in a simulated environment when interacting with the cockpit and multiple UAVs to provide insight into the effect of Human-Agent Interactions on workload and mission performance. This research concluded that peaks in workload occur for the pilot during periods of high communications load and this communication may be degraded or delayed during air-to-air engagements. © 2020 IEEE.},

In order to balance the contradiction between the supply and demand of airspace resources and reduce flight delays, it is necessary to carry out scientific and reasonable evaluation on the operational capacity of airspace system. As the most basic unit of airspace system, the operating environment of the control sector is increasingly complex, so the accurate evaluation of sector operating capacity becomes one of the preconditions for the fine measurement of airspace operating capacity. In this paper, the background of the research is discussed, the concept of sector capacity assessment, the characteristics of sector operation and the influencing factors of sector capacity are introduced in detail, and a new sector capacity and workload model for air traffic controllers based on least square method is proposed. According to the model, an optimized sector capacity evaluation method is proposed.

Although LOCI globally accounts for only 9\% of all analysed accidents IATA has reported that it was responsible for 58\% of all accident fatalities in 2017. The focus of this paper is to answer whether Threat and Error Management and Crew Resources Management (CRM) techniques are an efficient risk management tool when facing a LOC-I threat. Three LOCI final aircraft accident reports were analysed to understand the structure of Human Factors (HF) during these flights. Methods from the HF field such as the Generic Error Modelling System (GEMS) and Skill-, Rule- and Knowledge-based (SRK) error approach provided invaluable insights to identify potential findings. A holistic investigation of cognitive structures in flight path management helped to visualise latent conditions and cognitively demanding tasks during LOC-I in routine operations. Bearing in mind the limited number of cases considered in this paper it should be considered as an overview in LOC-I accident analysis. It shows that leadership and teamwork, as essential aspects of CRM training, can serve as key strategies to mitigate HF problems and LOC-I risks. © 2020 WITPress. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Emergency happens in human-UAV cooperation, such as criminal activity tracking and urgent needs for ground assistance. Emergency response usually has high requirements on the motion control of the multi-uav system, by maintaining both the team performance and team behaviors. However When a UAV swarm execute tasks in a real-world environment, because of real-world factors, such as system reliability and environmental disturbances, some robots in the swarm will behave abnormally, such as slow flocking speed, wrong heading direction, or poor spatial relations. In the meanwhile, incorrect trust between human and UAV swarm could map the abnormal behavior of faulty robot to the whole swarm and request an time consuming intervention from human supervisor, damage the UAV swarm response for dynamic task, even evolve to a failure of task because of accumulated error. To correct reflect the trust between human and UAV swarm and rebuild the trust to improve the performance caused by incorrect trust. We propose a dynamic trust repair model. The dynamic trust model focus on human-supervisory UAV system which can help UAV swarm to reduce the negative influence from faulty UAV on the performance of the UAV swarm, get a flexible reaction and stable human-supervisory UAV task performance. Results show that trust model could improve the performance of the swarm for dynamic task response and regain human trust. Copyright © 2020, The Authors. All rights reserved.},

This approach improves the traditional reward function through fusing the human cognitive property into it, and supplement the observable probability, which can reflect more close to reality's interaction process, to transition probability. In this paper, the typical simulation scenario is the pilot-cockpit cognitive interaction process when a malfunction occurs to airplane. The fragment of pilot manipulates airplane returning to air line is a continually process interacting with discrete pilot action decisions which can be modeled by MDP. The results of simulation indicate that this analysis methodology sufficiently illustrates dynamical variation of cognitive interaction process. The trend of workload value and reward value all prove that extended MDP approach accords with our expectation. © 2019 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: In future aeronautical system, the role of operators (pilots and air traffic controllers [ATCOs]) will be in transition from active controlling to passive monitoring. Therefore, the operators’ load (task, information, work and mental) model was developed. There were developed measuring systems integrating into the pilot and ATCOs working environment eye tracking system outside measuring equipment. Operator load management was created by using the measurement. Findings: In future system depending on time and automation level, the role of information and mental load will be increased.

	doi = {10.1155/2019/2089763},
	abstract = {Industry 4.0 in the contemporary operating context carries important sources of complexity. This context generates both traditional risks and emerging risks that must be managed. The management of these risks includes both industrial risks and occupational risks, since they are heavily interlinked. The human factor can be considered the main link between both types of risks. Thus, understanding risks originating from human errors and organizational weaknesses as causes of accidents and other disruptions in complex systems requires elaborating sophisticated modeling approaches. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose an organizational and human performance approach to improve the emerging risk management linked to the complex systems, like as Human-Machine Interactions (HMI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). To fulfill this objective, we first introduce the concept of emerging risk linked to human factor. Then, we introduce the concept of emerging risk management in the Industry 4.0 context. Under this complex context, we expose the concept considering the current models of risk management. Finally, we discuss how enhancing human and organizational performance can be achieved through risk management in complex systems linked to Industry 4.0. Therefore, we conclude that while Industry 4.0 brings numerous advantages, it must contend with emerging risks and challenges associated with organizational and human factors. These emerging risks include industrial risks as well as occupational risks. Moreover, the human factor aspect of Industry 4.0 is directly linked to industrial emerging and occupational emerging via context of operations. To cope with these new challenges, it is necessary to develop new approaches. One of such approaches is Complex System Governance. This approach is discussed along with the need for adequate organizational and human performance models dealing with, for example, experience from other domains such as nuclear, space, aviation, and petrochemical. © 2019 F.

The validity of the model was confirmed based on data collected from pilot operation experiments. Experiments were performed on five different operation tasks. Results showed that predicted values from the proposed model were highly correlated to actual error rates from the experiments. The findings indicate that the proposed error analysis model appears to be effective in the prediction of pilots’ error over time.

	abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing research on incorporating intelligent driver assistance systems (IDAS) into vehicular platforms to help drivers make better driving decisions and to make the roadways safer. The percentage of highway accidents in United States is steadily increasing every year. Current IDAS such as collision detection and avoidance systems use models of human behavior to improve the reliability of these systems and to help decrease driver workload. Modeling driver behavior is not a simple task. It involves aspects of psychology, physiology, data analysis, signal processing and engineering, to name a few. In the case of lane changing events, early detection of a driver’s intent to change lanes can be beneficial to systems that involve vehicle- to- vehicle communications. Moreover, a lane change prediction system, could be integrated into automatic aviation of the turn signal. Most published studies of lane change events are based on large scale vehicle trajectory data i.e steering angle, velocity and accelerations. Using this approach, a lane change prediction event is typically detected as soon as the driver initiates a lane change maneuver. Most vehicular trajectory model fails when a driver forgets to enable a turn signal before making a lane change. Hence, irrespective of having many automatic features equipped in modern day cars, the accident rate is still not decreasing. In such cases, biomedical signals may play an important role in detecting early driver intention. Besides vehicle dynamics (lane change, braking, acceleration), it is also important to understand the mental workload of the driver to maintain safety while travelling. Mental workload is directly related to distracted or non- distracted driving which varies with emotional changes. The mental workload can tremendously impact driving behavior and hence the detection of these factors will add driver safety on roadway.In this dissertation, we propose to utilize visual and cognitive information to detect a driver’s intent to change lanes and predict their mental distraction. Mental workload varies in different situations. For example, the amount of focus required during a lane change maneuver can be disrupted due to a secondary task like cell phone usage, talking to a co-passenger, a baby crying in the back seat or an unexpected news broadcasted on the car radio. Most of the research focuses on distracted driving using a cell phone, although more number of accidents are accounted on highways during talking to passengers. In this research, conversational task with co –passengers are considered as a situation, for intent analysis and cognitive workload analysis of the driver. A novel approach is developed that considers eye movements and cognitive attentiveness as distraction levels are increased during two different scenarios (i) single passenger driving and (ii) driving with passengers. This involves aspects of statistical analysis, signal processing, software engineering and machine learning techniques. Different types of statistical analysis techniques like normalization, correlation models are used in this research. Software development with TCL scripting is utilized to design real time virtual scenario for data collection. Signal Processing techniques like power spectral analysis, cognitive engagement ratio etc. are utilized to analyze brain signals. Artificial Intelligence methods are applied to help make accurate predictions of driver intent. Finally, Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms to mimic human cognition. This research utilizes innovative machine learning tools like sklearn and tensor flow, to automate the process of behavior analysis.This work will inform research on lane-change prediction, behavior prediction and vehicular feedback analysis using an IDAS environment. Furthermore, this work considers factors that may impact the lane change detection and prediction of differential drivers including elderly drivers. This work also contributes an individual database that records driving behaviors during conversational tasks that other researchers can use to conduct behavior analysis research associated with this driving scenario. To author’s knowledge this is the first database that will be made available publicly for use in conversational task scenario in driving.This dissertation is composed of five chapters. Chapter 1 presents the introduction and back ground of IDAS research. It highlights various factors that contribute to detrimental road crashes and describes the research gap in this field. Chapter 2 includes a detailed literature review of all the studies that has been conducted in this field and also includes essential biological and artificial intelligence methods that are important to know in order this field. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology that has been adopted in this project. It includes description of virtual reality development procedure for collecting data from driver simulator, data collection procedure for various parameter in this research and also describes the mathematical models of each concept. Chapter 4 consists of results, discussion and the importance of novel distraction recognition algorithm. Finally, conclusion, limitations and future work are discussed in chapter 5.

	abstract = {In order to solve the problem of CGF formation avoiding obstacles, avoiding collisions and reach the target point in the simulated battlefield environment, combined with the behaviour-based method, the following algorithm will be improved to control the CGF formation. In this paper, the motion of CGF formation is decomposed into moving to target, maintaining formation, avoiding obstacles, restoring formation, reaching target, and a linear feedback mechanism based on the relative position of leader and follower is introduced to prevent the occurrence of the team. The tangent obstacle avoidance algorithm evades obstacles. The simulation experiment applies the upper-layer behavioural reasoning to guide the structure of the underlying physical model, and the SOAR agent makes the choice of the state of the environment and the behaviour, and the underlying physical model implements the behaviour. The results show that the strategy can keep the CGF formation in the desired formation, avoid internal collisions while avoiding obstacles, and quickly restore the formation after reaching obstacles, reach the target location and achieve good results. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

This paper discusses a method for enabling the shared HR task scheduling and dynamic re-scheduling. Humans, robots, and HR teams are involved in the resources model, while the task sequence and the task precedence constraints consist of the workload model. An intelligent multi-criteria decision-making framework is proposed for evaluating alternative solutions for the shared HR task scheduling. Dynamic re-scheduling is possible in the cases of unexpected events during the execution of the task. The dynamic rescheduling is triggered by IEC61499 events generated in running time. The method has been implemented as a software tool in Java and has been demonstrated in the hybrid assembly of a vehicle turbocharger. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	title = {Machine learning algorithms to improve model accuracy and latency and human-autonomy teaming},
	doi = {10.2514/6.2018-4063},
	abstract = {Improving the approach to the development of algorithms that allow machine agents to act independently within a circumscribed set of goals has garnered more traction, over recent years, than just a phase of observation, but has progressed rapidly into the necessary stage of small to moderate scale implementation. This is evident when operating in those areas that were once considered for human tasking only, particularly the area of aviation. The introduction of autonomous agents within the cockpit of an aircraft remains a very detailed and complex endeavor; one that requires arduous verification and validation of the agent’s ability to perform its task in a complex connected national airspace system (NAS), where in 2025 daily aircraft operations are predicted to number 95,000 – twice that recorded in 2016. In addition, these machine agents are required to work in concert with humans and other manned aircraft. This is accomplished with the agent(s) achieving a task(s) that help reduce pilot workload, without the degradation of aviation safety, reliability, costs, or operational efficiency. Therefore, it is vital that the proper performance of any cockpit related task given to this burgeoning technology be vetted thoroughly to facilitate trust between human and machine, and help further human autonomy teaming (HAT). As a step toward these goals, a modified increasingly autonomous system (IAS) has been developed that optimizes the identification, distribution, and rendering of "relevant" air traffic onto the ownship’s navigation display for use in a NAS Net-Centric environment. This paper describes the second phase of our work in this effort and the necessary V\&V to prove out its ability as an autonomous cockpit agent. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

At the request of the FAA, MITRE examined how a future set of automation enhancements for the TRACON domain will impact air traffic controller workflow, task times, and mental effort. The MITRE team assessed these operational impacts to the controller through task modeling with a tool called Cogulator. We modeled tasks representing operations with today's tools (as-is) and use of the TRACON automation enhancements (to-be). Our modeling results show how a controller's workflow changes when the controller chooses to use the TRACON automation enhancements. These workflow changes include electronic communication in place of voice communication, as well as earlier notification of separation and spacing conflicts. Our results also demonstrate other impacts of using the automation enhancements: shorter task times associated with each capability and mental effort levels that decrease or stay the same. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This volume provides an exceptional perspective on the nature, evolution, contributions and future of the field of Cognitive Systems Engineering (CSE). It is a resource to support both the teaching and practice of CSE. It accomplishes this through its organization into two complementary approaches to the topic. The first is an historical perspective: In the retrospections of leaders of the field, what have been the seminal achievements of cognitive human factors? What are the "lessons learned" that became foundational to CSE, and how did that foundation evolve into a broader systems view of cognitive work? The second perspective is both pedagogical and future-looking: What are the major conceptual issues that have to be addressed by CSE and how can a new generation of researchers be prepared to further advance CSE? Topics include studies of expertise, cognitive work analysis, cognitive task analysis, human performance, system design, cognitive modeling, decision making, human-computer interaction, trust in automation, teamwork and ecological interface design. A thematic focus will be on systems-level analysis, and such notions as resilience engineering and systems-level measurement. The book features broad coverage of many of the domains to which CSE is being applied, among them industrial process control, health care, decision aiding and aviation human factors. The book’s contributions are provided by an extraordinary group of leaders and pathfinders in applied psychology, cognitive science, systems analysis and system design. In combination these chapters present invaluable insights, experiences and continuing uncertainties on the subject of the field of CSE, and in doing so honor the career and achievements of Professor David D.

	abstract = {Humans share the same basic cognitive architecture with all primates, but they have evolved abilities to exercise abstract control over cognition and to process more complex relational patterns. The human cognitive architecture consists of a set of largely independent modules associated with different brain regions. In this book John Anderson discusses in detail how these various modules can combine to produce behaviors as varied as driving a car and solving an algebraic equation, but focuses principally on two of the modules: the declarative and the procedural. The declarative module involves a memory system that, moment by moment, attempts to give each person the most appropriate possible window into his or her past. The procedural module involves a central system that strives to develop a set of productions that will enable the most adaptive response from any state of the modules. In addressing the question of how the mind exists in the physical universe, Anderson organizes his answer around the ACT-R architecture, but broadens it by bringing in research from all areas of cognitive science, including how recent work in brain imaging maps onto the cognitive architecture.

In both concept domains we review theories and design principles, and particularly computational models of attentional process and performance outputs. In discussing the filter we consider supervisory control, noticing, visual search, and the way in which limited selective attention constrains the filter can be overcome to avail more parallel processing via techniques of display overlay and object display. In discussing the fuel for multi-tasking, we distinguish between the parallel processing supported by multiple resources, and the sequential processing and task switching required when demands are excessive.},

The theory specifies the optimal observation and decision processes for detecting electronic signals against a background of random interference or noise. It was seen immediately by psychologists as a model for detection and discrimination by human observers, and as specifying methods of data collection and analysis. The theory's ‘receiver operating characteristic’ (ROC) provides separate measures of two independent aspects of performance, sensitivity and the decision criterion. Experiments confirmed the validity of the theory for sensory tasks while rejecting extant threshold theories. SDT has since been applied as well to a variety of cognitive tasks. It has also been applied to a variety of practical diagnostic tasks—in clinical psychology, clinical medicine, information retrieval, weather forecasting, lie detection, aptitude testing, and materials testing.},

It also uses a team-centered version of the Information, Decision and Action cognitive model and "macro-cognitive" abstractions of crew behavior, as well as relevant findings from cognitive psychology literature and operating experience, to identify potential causes of failures and influencing factors during procedure-driven and knowledge-supported crew-plant interactions. The result is the set of identified HFEs and likely scenarios leading to each.

	abstract = {There is a current drive towards enabling the deployment of increasingly autonomous systems in the National Airspace System (NAS). However, shifting the traditional roles and responsibilities between humans and automation for safety critical tasks must be managed carefully, otherwise the current emergent safety properties of the NAS may be disrupted. In this paper, a verification activity to assess the emergent safety properties of a clearly defined, safety critical, operational scenario that possesses tasks that can be fluidly allocated between human and automated agents is conducted. Task allocation role sets were proposed for a human-automation team performing a contingency maneuver in a reduced crew context. A safety critical contingency procedure (engine out on takeoff) was modeled in the Soar cognitive architecture, then translated into the Hybrid Input Output formalism. Verification activities were then performed to determine whether or not the safety properties held over the increasingly autonomous system. The verification activities lead to the development of several key insights regarding the implicit assumptions on agent capability. It subsequently illustrated the usefulness of task annotations associated with specialized requirements (e.g., communication, timing etc.), and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. © 2016 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Established techniques like the cognitive workload analysis that can be used to assess the individual perceived operator workload for sets of tasks these are not widely used in industrial development. That is, because cognitive analysis of dynamic systems depends on complex architectures and simulations to evaluate workload over time, and is still driven by proprietary notations for cognitive models that require in-depth cognitive modeling skills and is currently only accessible to experts. In this paper we present an extension to CogTool, the Human Efficiency Evaluator (HEE) to ease the analysis of the impact of new instruments and new display designs with respect to human operator workload and task execution times. The tool is designed to make these cognitive analysis techniques available to non-experts, such as system analysts and engineers. We explain the cognitive modeling and analysis process supported by the HEE referring to an aeronautics scenario presented earlier by Hutchins. The cognitive analysis compares the task performance and workload of three generations of cockpit instrument designs to support pilots' with the slats/flaps settings during an aircraft approach with the current support in modern aircrafts and was performed by using the HEE. © 2015 ACM.},

Situation awareness has been recognized as an important phenomenon in almost all domains where safety is of highest importance and complex decision making is inevitable. This paper discusses analysis, modelling and simulation of three scenarios in the aviation domain where poor situation awareness plays a main role, and which have been explained by Endsley according to her three level situation awareness model.

The pilot error model built can be used not only to analysis the reason of accident but predict the error probability in particular scene. The model is validated through the experiment that pilots read the altitude during flight in different visibilities and time limits. The CPC (common performance conditions) including cockpit design, crew communication and other environment such as weather condition is always analyzed and calculated during the whole task analysis and then the reason of pilot error can be discovered qualitatively.

	abstract = {Design of future systems for flight-deck automation will reflect a trend of changing the paradigm of human-computer interaction from the master (human)- slave (machine) mode to more equilibrated cooperation. In many cases such cooperation considers several humans and computer systems, for which multi-agent dynamic cooperative systems are appropriate models. Development of such systems requires very profound analysis of mutual interactions and conflicts that may arise in such systems. Additional testing is exhaustive and expensive for such systems. In the scope of the D3CoS project these problems are addressed from the modelling point of view with ambition to create tools that will simplify the development phase and replace parts of the testing phase. In this paper we investigate common flight procedures, for which computer assistance could be developed. We show how formal modelling of procedures allows us to inspect procedural inconsistencies and workload peaks before the development starts. We show how a computer cognitive architecture (a virtual pilot) can simulate human pilot behaviour in the cockpit to address questions typical for the early phase of the development. Analysis of these questions allows us to reduce the number of candidates for the final implementation without the need of expensive experiments with human pilots. This modelling approach is demonstrated on experiments undertaken both with human pilots and a virtual pilot. The quality of the outcome from both experimental settings remains conserved as shown by physiological assessment of pilot workload, which in turn justifies the use of the modelling approach for this type of problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

Cognitive systems appear to be a promising approach to overcome these deficiencies in future combat aircraft. Developing humancentered automation and designing advanced technology that will capitalize on the relative strengths of humans and machines, are key to the success. This paper presents the approach of applying the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in the critical mission computer (MC). The mission computer is the central controller of the entire avionics and acts as the front end to the pilot and all other avionic systems by providing all the sensors information, presenting the pilot-vehicle interface and thereby helping a lot in reducing the heavy workload of the pilot. Hence cognitive processing in the MC will make MC to act as an electronic crew assistant sharing the workload of the pilot and helping him in severe situations. Intricate aircraft systems increase the need for intelligent cooperation between pilots and aircraft which will be fulfilled by making the MC as smart or intelligent MC. © 2013 DESIDOC.},

	abstract = {BICA (Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures) is a DARPA Phase-I program whose goal is to create the next generation of cognitive architecture models based on principles of psychology and neuroscience. This project is motivated by the belief that traditional artificial intelligence research has hit a wall in its quest to develop truly intelligent agents: although agents can be engineered to perform exceedingly well at specific tasks, they are typically quite brittle, unable to deal with unforeseen situations and unable to learn from others. This paper describes the BICA Cognitive Decathlon, Challenge Scenarios, and Biovalidity Assessment, a set of tests we designed to evaluate the performance of such agents in a variety of situations that cover a core set of cognitive, perceptual, and motor skills typical for a two-year-old human child. These include behavioral tasks related to search, navigation, manipulation, memory, language, and three pathways to procedural knowledge: instruction, demonstration, and reinforcement/exploration. The test suite has three distinct components: a set of four integrative challenge scenarios that support the goals of building coherent, systematic, integrated cognitive agents; a set of focused tasks that can better determine the extent to which the core cognitive competencies match the capabilities of humans; and a set of biovalidity assessments to determine the extent to which the agents architecture resembles the human brain. Ultimately, this three-level set of tests was designed to evaluate whether systems are flexible, comprehensive, and taskable in complex situations, while still performing tasks in ways similar to human performers. The test specification and the motivations for and background of individual tasks will be discussed.},

These systems must integrate computer-based technologies that help the human operator place attention on the right tasks at the right times to be successful. One way to assist the operator in this process is to compute where the operator's attention should be focused and then use this computation to influence the operator's behavior. In this paper, we analyze the ability of a particular modeling method to make such computations for effective attention allocation in humanmultiple-robot systems. Our results demonstrate that it is not sufficient to simply compute and dictate how operators should allocate their attention. Rather, in stochastic domains, where small changes in either the endogenous or exogenous environment can dramatically affect model fidelity, model predictions should guide rather than dictate operator attentional resources so that operators can effectively exercise their judgment and experience. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes computational models of situated work in complex, heterogeneous dynamic systems that include humans, physical systems, computer agents and regulatory requirements, using aviation as the domain being examined but highlighting modeling principles generalizable to other domains. Work is defined formally here as purposeful activity acting on, and responding to, the environment as required by the situation. This work is performed by a team of automated and human agents, and involves both cognitive and physical activity. At its most atomic, work may be represented as actions that evaluate the current situation, and then act on the environment, as well as 'teamwork' actions and 'decision actions' whereby agents evaluate the situation to select the appropriate sets of actions (i.e. strategies). Work is thus a response to the situation, with strategies chosen in response to the physical environment, the allocation of responsibility within the team; and agent status including expertise, the demands on the agent, and resources available to the agent such as time and information. In addition, a description of the structures inherent to work is also used to organize the actions into an abstraction hierarchy: at the bottom are the resources and actions, but at higher levels of abstraction more aggregate functions provide descriptions that relate the detailed actions to the specific goals of the work. Historically, such models have been used qualitatively, but had a disconnect from computational modeling of situated behavior. Therefore, this paper details how they may be dynamically simulated to examine how work can be studied dynamically as situated within a dynamic environment driving, and responding to, agent activity. © 2011 IEEE.},

The initial goal is an enhanced C2 system for small unmanned aircraft vehicles (SUAVs). Our approach is to use adaptive display technology to improve shared situation awareness between the SUAV Commander and the SUAV Operator, to provide new channels of Commander-Operator communication, and to reduce Commander workload. At the core of our approach is a tri-modal adaptive interface display which involves adaptive information presentation in order to balance workload and to promote effective human-system performance. This novel design came about as a direct result of field observations during a full-scale military exercise and a cognitive task analysis (CTA) based on these observations. Using the CTA, we designed the basic Commander's adaptive interface format and automated triggering methods. A priori GOMS analysis predicted a 50\% decrease in time on task, based on a subset of representative tasks. Data collection to date supports these predictions. Furthermore, feedback from subject matter experts and comparisons between user performance on TECRA versus an existing SUAV platform suggests that TECRA is easier to use, quicker to learn, and provides more capabilities to the user than current systems. These results demonstrate how the TECRA application - driven by a cognitive analysis of the Commander's task, by a mission model of the anticipated Commander's needs, and by mission templates and real-time robotic data - has been able to validate theories of human-automation interaction in real-world domains such as unmanned aviation and military command and control. ©2010 IEEE.},

As a result, additional theoretical problems must be addressed to bring cognitive architectures to bear on the study of cognition in dynamic and interactive environments. I identify and discuss three such problems dealing with the need to model the sensitivity of behavior to environmental constraints, the need to model context-specific adaptations underlying expertise, and the need for environmental modeling at a functional level.

Definitely, the cognitive model helps to understand user behaviors. However, we noticed behavioral differences between users that are hardly explainable only by the cognitive model.

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Intelligent agent technology has advanced to the point where it can potentially provide a cost-effective replacement for teammates, coaches, and opponents in simulation-based training (SBT). However, the introduction of intelligent agents into training applications is not without its share of challenges given the many roles that intelligent agents can potentially play and the unique requirements of each role. For example, intelligent agents can play the role of teammates, opponents, supervisors, subordinates, coach, and mentor. The required level of intelligence depends on the functions that the agent is required to perform in these various roles. For example, agents performing as "extras" in a scene require little or no intelligence (i.e., they don't have to be intelligent), whereas an After-Action Review (AAR) agent requires the ability to diagnose deficiencies relative to, for example, the school solution. To perform some functions, agents require an understanding of the problem domain; for others they merely need to understand their own tasks. In some cases, agents need the ability to plan. In other cases they merely need the ability to react. A pedagogical agent might need a human persona to enhance learner motivation and learner-system interaction. It is important to realize that when intelligent agents are used to replace a human, it is not necessarily the case that the functions performed by the human are mapped to a single agent; rather, for ease of authoring and maintenance, it might be entirely advantageous to employ multiple, cooperating agents to perform the functions. The implementation of these various kinds of agents for simulation-based training (SBT) can take a variety of forms that vary in their level of sophistication. For example, a pedagogical agent typically requires some reasoning facilities to diagnose student deficiencies and create a remediation plan. Such an agent can be implemented using agent modeling languages or expert system shells. At the other end of the spectrum, agents that fulfill the role of "extras" can be conveniently modeled as time-driven, message-passing entities. Similarly, superior and subordinate agents that are not key actors in a scenario can be represented as event-driven, message-passing entities to reduce implementation costs. Depending on the training context, teammate implementations can vary from simple condition-action, messaging entities to sophisticated cognitive agents based on cognitive architectures such as ACT-R or Soar. In this paper, we provide specific examples of the use of intelligent agents for individual and team training. In particular, we present a detailed discussion of an intelligent pedagogical agent along with an example of its use. We also present the key issues in the design of synthetic teammates aad intelligent adversaries. Copyright © 2005 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

	volume = {2485},
	doi = {10.1007/3-540-36080-8_1},
	abstract = {Operator models, or equivalent end-user models have become a standard prerequisite in most man-machine system design. Nowadays, the designer can choose among a great variety of models, e.g., behavioural models and competence models, and these models are available in a large range of granularity from quasineuropsychological models of memory to framework models of dynamic cognition. However, despite -or maybe because of- the variety of models, modelling the operator is still a land of contrasts within the industry, with multiple forms and meanings, and as result a feeling persists that these models, which are meant to be useful, are difficult to incorporate into the design process or the operations. This conference focuses on the development and use of cognitive models of human reliability, and tries to understand the biases and limitations of their use in design of safe systems within the industry. It is divided into three sections. The first section details the range of existing cognitive models of human reliability and proposes a classification of these models into four main categories: error production models, error detection and recovery models, systemic models, and integrated safety ecological models. The example of the Aviation Industry shows how difficult it has been in the recent past to incorporate the most advanced of these models into design, even though the same Industry has long complained that such cognitive operators' models were not available. The second section tries to explain the reason for the relative failure. It shows the inter-dependency existing between the category of cognitive model, the safety paradigm, and the strategy for design. Severe drawbacks may occur each time a model is used with the wrong safety paradigm or the wrong strategy for design. It also shows that the more cognitively-based the model is, the less it is incorporated into design. The lack of education in psychology for designers, as well as the lack of a clear procedure for incorporating such models into design, are among the most important factors explaining this lack of success. The third and last section points to the new directions in cognitive modelling to improve the fit between operator modelling and design requirements. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

Our understanding of how the collaborative efforts spent by teams relate to their performance is still a matter of debate. Teamwork results in a highly interconnected ecosystem of potentially overlapping components where tasks are performed in interaction with team members and across other teams. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph neural network model to predict a team’s performance while identifying the drivers determining such outcome. In particular, the model is based on three architectural channels: topological, centrality, and contextual, which capture different factors potentially shaping teams’ success. We endow the model with two attention mechanisms to boost model performance and allow interpretability. A first mechanism allows pinpointing key members inside the team. A second mechanism allows us to quantify the contributions of the three driver effects in determining the outcome performance. We test model performance on various domains, outperforming most classical and neural baselines. Moreover, we include synthetic datasets designed to validate how the model disentangles the intended properties on which our model vastly outperforms baselines. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective
We define human–autonomy teaming and offer a synthesis of the existing empirical research on the topic. Specifically, we identify the research environments, dependent variables, themes representing the key findings, and critical future research directions.
Background
Whereas a burgeoning literature on high-performance teamwork identifies the factors critical to success, much less is known about how human–autonomy teams (HATs) achieve success. Human–autonomy teamwork involves humans working interdependently toward a common goal along with autonomous agents. Autonomous agents involve a degree of self-government and self-directed behavior (agency), and autonomous agents take on a unique role or set of tasks and work interdependently with human team members to achieve a shared objective.
Method
We searched the literature on human–autonomy teaming. To meet our criteria for inclusion, the paper needed to involve empirical research and meet our definition of human–autonomy teaming. We found 76 articles that met our criteria for inclusion.
Results
We report on research environments and we find that the key independent variables involve autonomous agent characteristics, team composition, task characteristics, human individual differences, training, and communication. We identify themes for each of these and discuss the future research needs.
Conclusion
There are areas where research findings are clear and consistent, but there are many opportunities for future research. Particularly important will be research that identifies mechanisms linking team input to team output variables.},

	abstract = {Within human factors there is burgeoning interest in the “human-autonomy teaming” (HAT) concept as a way to address the challenges of interacting with complex, increasingly autonomous systems. The HAT concept comes out of an aspiration to interact with increasingly autonomous systems as a team member, rather than simply use automation as a tool. The authors, and others, have proposed core tenets for HAT that include bi-directional communication, automation and system transparency, and advanced coordination between human and automated teammates via predefined, dynamic task sequences known as “plays.” It is believed that, with proper implementation, HAT should foster appropriate teamwork, thus increasing trust and reliance on the system, which in turn will reduce workload, increase situation awareness, and improve performance. To this end, HAT has been demonstrated and/or studied in multiple applications including search and rescue operations, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, photography, and aviation. The current paper presents one such effort to apply HAT. It details the design of a HAT agent, developed by Human Automation Teaming Solutions, Inc., to facilitate teamwork between the automation and the human operator of an advanced ground dispatch station. This dispatch station was developed to support a NASA project investigating a concept called Reduced Crew Operations (RCO); consequently, we have named the agent R-HATS. Part of the RCO concept involves a ground operator providing enhanced support to a large number of aircraft with a single pilot on the flight deck. When assisted by R-HATS, operators can monitor and support or manage a large number of aircraft and use plays to respond in real-time to complicated, workload-intensive events (e.g., an airport closure). A play is a plan that encapsulates goals, tasks, and a task allocation strategy appropriate for a particular situation. In the current implementation, when a play is initiated by a user, R-HATS determines what tasks need to be completed and has the ability to autonomously execute them (e.g., determining diversion options and uplinking new routes to aircraft) when it is safe and appropriate. R-HATS has been designed to both support end users and researchers in RCO and HAT. Additionally, R-HATS and its underlying architecture were developed with generaliz ability in mind as a modular software applicable outside of RCO/aviation domains. This paper will also discuss future further development and testing of R-HATS.},

	abstract = {Automation has entered nearly every aspect of our lives, but it often remains hard to understand. Why is this? Automation is often brittle, requiring constant human oversight to assure it operates as intended. This oversight has become harder as automation has become more complicated. To resolve this problem, Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) has been proposed. HAT is based on advances in providing automation transparency, a method for giving insight into the reasoning behind automated recommendations and actions, along with advances in human automation communications (e.g., voice). These, in turn, permit more trust in the automation when appropriate, and less when not, allowing a more targeted supervision of automated functions. This paper proposes a framework for HAT, incorporating three key tenets: transparency, bi-directional communication, and operator directed authority. These tenets, along with more capable automation, represent a shift in human-automation relations.},

	abstract = {Considering the foreseen expansion of the air transportation system within the next two decades and the opportunities offered by higher levels of automation, Single-Pilot Operations (SPO) are regarded as viable alternatives to conventional two-pilot operations for commercial transport aircraft. In comparison with current operations, SPO require higher cognitive efforts, which potentially result in increased human error rates. This article proposes a novel Cognitive Pilot-Aircraft Interface (CPAI) concept, which introduces adaptive knowledge-based system functionalities to assist single pilots in the accomplishment of mission-essential and safety-critical tasks in modern commercial transport aircraft. The proposed CPAI system implementation is based on real-time detection of the pilot’s physiological and cognitive states, allowing the avoidance of pilot errors and supporting enhanced synergies between the human and the avionics systems. These synergies yield significant improvements in the overall performance and safety levels. A CPAI working process consisting of sensing, estimation and reconfiguration steps is developed to support the assessment of physiological and external conditions, a dynamic allocation of tasks and adaptive alerting. Suitable mathematical models are introduced to estimate the mental demand associated to each piloting task and to assess the pilot cognitive states. Suitably implemented decision logics allow a continuous and optimal adjustment of the automation levels as a function of the estimated cognitive states. Representative numerical simulation test cases provide a preliminary validation of the CPAI concept. In particular, the continuous adaptation of the flight deck's automation successfully maintains the pilot's task load within an optimal range, mitigating the onset of hazardous fatigue levels. It is anticipated that by including suitably designed Psychophysiological-Based Integrity Augmentation (PBIA) functionalities the CPAI system will allow to fulfil the evolving aircraft certification requirements and hence support the implementation of SPO in commercial transport aircraft.},

Automation transparency is a design principle that could support humans by making the automation?s inner workings observable (i.e., ?seeing-into?). However, experimental support for this has not been systematically documented to date.MethodBased on the PRISMA method, a broad and systematic search of the literature was performed focusing on identifying empirical research investigating the effect of transparency on central Human Factors variables.ResultsOur final sample consisted of 17 experimental studies that investigated transparency in a controlled setting. The studies typically employed three human-automation interaction types: responding to agent-generated proposals, supervisory control of agents, and monitoring only. There is an overall trend in the data pointing towards a beneficial effect of transparency. However, the data reveals variations in Situation Awareness, mental workload, and operator performance for specific tasks, agent-types, and level of integration of transparency information in primary task displays.ConclusionOur data suggests a promising effect of automation transparency on Situation Awareness and operator performance, without the cost of added mental workload, for instances where humans respond to agent-generated proposals and where humans have a supervisory role.ApplicationStrategies to improve human performance when interacting with intelligent agents should focus on allowing humans to see into its information processing stages, considering the integration of information in existing Human Machine Interface solutions.},

As the potential for true BVLOS operations comes more plausible and possible in Canada (and around the world) it is apparent that operators will look to gain further efficiencies and enhanced capabilities achievable through autonomous aircraft operations. Likewise there is growing interest in the adoption of increasing levels of automation in traditional aviation platforms as well as newly emerging advanced air mobility (AAM) platforms. Although technical and regulatory challenges remain, research, experimentation and development is already rapidly evolving to focus on autonomous operations of RPAS and Optionally Piloted Vehicles (OPV) in the coming BVLOS environment. In the area of certification, “autonomous1” aircraft operations present a complex challenge in a number of domains, to which traditional approaches applied to aircraft avionics are not well suited. Recent experience with the certification of rotorcraft fly-by-wire systems, amongst many other examples of advanced technology, have highlighted the need for regulators to better understand and anticipate the technical complexities of these rapidly evolving technologies},

Then, we discuss GANs U+02BC advantages and disadvantages, and their development trends.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding more uses in the human society resulting in a need to scrutinise the relationship between humans and AI. Technology itself has advanced from the mere encoding of human knowledge into a machine to designing machines that “know how” to autonomously acquire the knowledge they need, learn from it and act independently in the environment. Fortunately, this need is not new; it has scientific grounds that could be traced back to the inception of computers. This paper uses a multi-disciplinary lens to explore how the natural cognitive intelligence in a human could interface with the artificial cognitive intelligence of a machine. The scientific journey over the last 50 years will be examined to understand the Human-AI relationship, and to present the nature of, and the role of trust in, this relationship. Risks and opportunities sitting at the human-AI interface will be studied to reveal some of the fundamental technical challenges for a trustworthy human-AI relationship. The critical assessment of the literature leads to the conclusion that any social integration of AI into the human social system would necessitate a form of a relationship on one level or another in society, meaning that humans will “always” actively participate in certain decision-making loops—either in-the-loop or on-the-loop—that will influence the operations of AI, regardless of how sophisticated it is.},

We present a Coactive Design method and show how it can be a useful approach for developers trying to understand how to translate high-level teamwork concepts into reusable control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors that enable robots to fulfill their envisioned role as teammates. As an example of the coactive design approach, we present our results from the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge, a competition designed to spur development of advanced robots that can assist humans in recovering from natural and man-made disasters.

	abstract = {The next -generation human spaceflight vehicle is in a unique position to realize the benefits of more than thirty years of technological advancements since the Space Shuttle was designed. Computer enhancements, the emergence of highly reliable decision-making algorithms, and an emphasis on efficiency make an increased use of autonomous systems highly likely. NASA is in a position to take advantage of these advances and apply them to the human spaceflight environment. One of the key paradigm shifts will be the shift, where appropriate, of monitoring, option development, decision-making, and execution responsibility from humans to an Autonomous Flight Management (AFM) system. As an effort to reduce risk for development of an AFM system, NASA engineers are developing a prototype to prove the utility of previously untested autonomy concepts. This prototype, called SMART (Spacecraft Mission Assessment and Re -planning Tool), is a functionally decomposed flight management system with an appropriate level of autonomy for each of its functions. As the development of SMART began, the most important and most often asked question was, “How autonomous should an AFM system be?” A thorough study of the literature through 2002 surrounding autonomous systems has not yielded a standard method for designing a level of autonomy into either a crewed vehicle or an uncrewed vehicle. The current focus in the literature on defining autonomy is centered on developing IQ tests for built systems. The literature that was analyzed assumes that the goal of all systems is to strive for complete autonomy from human intervention, rather than identifying how autonomous each function within the system should have been. In contrast, the SMART team developed a method for determining the appropriate level of autonomy to be designed into each function within a system. This paper summarizes the development of the Level of Autonomy Assessment Tool and its application to the SMART project. The conclusion from this on-going effort demonstrates that the Level of Autonomy Assessment Tool is a viable method for determining the appropriate level of autonomy for each function within a system.},

	abstract = {Modern in-vehicle information and communication devices are changing the nature of the driving task. Drivers take it for granted that they are able to divide their attention between the primary task of driving and secondary tasks like monitoring information displays or using mobile phones. While it is commonly accepted that driver information overload can compromise traffic safety, attempts to introduce attention management within the vehicle are nowadays limited to restrictive decisions by legislative bodies. In an increasing number of countries, the use of hands-free phones is enforced by law. In some countries, the use of phones while driving is prohibited altogether. We argue that there is a more intelligent solution to the information overload issue, namely an adaptive man–machine interface that filters information presentation according to situational requirements. We implemented such a filter as a projective real-time computational workload estimator which is based on the assessment of traffic situations detected from an on-board geographical database. Workload estimates are refined by data from sensors that monitor the traffic environment and variables of driving dynamics. The prototype system is operational in a demonstrator vehicle. Whenever the workload estimate exceeds a threshold value, incoming telephone calls are automatically redirected to the telephone mailbox without notifying the driver. An evaluation field experiment that employed objective and subjective methods of assessing workload yielded promising results in terms of the possibilities of reducing workload by means of the adaptive interface. The results are in favour of the idea of a futuristic, situation-aware vehicle which has the potential to enhance comfort and safety while driving.},

The experimental results show that with an increased mental workload, the detection accuracy of flight operation significantly reduced and the reaction time was significantly prolonged; the standard deviation of R-R intervals (SDNN) significantly decreased, while the mean heart rate exhibited little change; the score of NASA\_TLX scale significantly increased. On this basis, the indexes sensitive to mental workload were screened, and an integrated model for the discrimination and prediction of mental workload of aircraft cockpit display interface was established based on the Bayesian Fisher discrimination and classification method. The original validation and cross-validation methods were employed to test the accuracy of the results of discrimination and prediction of the integrated model, and the average prediction accuracies determined by these two methods are both higher than 85\%. Meanwhile, the integrated model shows a higher accuracy in discrimination and prediction of mental workload compared with single indexes. The model proposed in this paper exhibits a satisfactory coincidence with the measured data and could accurately reflect the variation characteristics of the mental workload of aircraft cockpit display interface, thus providing a basis for the ergonomic evaluation and optimization design of the aircraft cockpit display interface in the future.},

Some approaches are based on the structure of team communication; others draw from dynamical systems theory to consider perspectives across different timescales; other approaches leverage features of team members’ voices or facial expressions to detect emotional states that can provide windows into other workings of the team; still others consider the content of communication to produce insights. Taken together, these approaches comprise a varied toolkit for deriving critical information about how team interactions affect, and are affected by, coordination, trust, cohesion, and performance outcomes. Future research directions describe four critical areas for further study of communication in human-autonomy teams.},

However, a detailed analysis of the impact of advanced autonomy on pilot workload through various phases of flight and contingency scenarios has not been conducted. To this end, this paper presents the development of the Pilot-Autonomy Workload Simulation (PAWS), a discrete event simulation model that allows the investigation of pilot workload under a variety of advanced autonomy capabilities and scenarios. Initial utilization results from PAWS of nominal and off-nominal point-to-point missions demonstrate that the workload for a single pilot assisted by advanced autonomy varies considerably over different phases of flight and various contingencies. These results suggest that advanced autonomy to offset pilot workload is not needed for low-workload phases, but could be critical during periods of high workload.},

mance in complicated human-machine systems. The current work demonstrates a pilot
model capable of performing and simulating pre-flight preparation and take-off duties. The
model was developed using the Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational
(QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture and can be connected to flight simulators like X-Plane
to create various data types such as performance and mental workload. Declarative knowl-
edge chunks, production rules, and a collection of parameters all contribute to the model’s
output. A human experiment involving pre-flight and take-off tasks was conducted to
acquire the data required for the model’s development. At the moment, the model can
generate flight operation behaviors that are comparable to that of human pilots. By com-
paring model data to human data, it was demonstrated that QN-ACTR may be utilized
to develop a multi-task model that accurately simulates pilot behavior. With further re-
finement, including support for situational awareness simulations, such models may help
to evaluate interfaces and competency-based pilot training, complementing human-in-the-

However, especially in critical situations, it is highly relevant to know whether information has been processed correctly or been missed. We propose cognitive assistance and give an example of how formalized understanding and anticipation of pilot behavior in response to flight deck alerts can be implemented. The proposed cognitive assistance creates an understanding of the global context of the operation, comprising pilot state (cognitive, emotional), the environment (e.g. weather, traffic, obstacles), the operational context (e.g. Air Traffic Control instructions, system status), and the current task context. The concept of understanding others also provides the foundation for mutual understanding in future human-machine teaming, although additional aspects must be considered by such systems.},

	abstract = {This study presents the integration of a passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) and cognitive modeling as a method to trace pilots’ perception and processing of auditory alerts and messages during operations. Missing alerts on the flight deck can result in out-of-the-loop problems that can lead to accidents. By tracing pilots’ perception and responses to alerts, cognitive assistance can be provided based on individual needs to ensure they maintain adequate situation awareness. Data from 24 participating aircrew in a simulated flight study that included multiple alerts and air traffic control messages in single pilot setup are presented. A classifier was trained to identify pilots’ neurophysiological reactions to alerts and messages from participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG). A neuroadaptive ACT-R model using EEG data was compared to a conventional normative model regarding accuracy in representing individual pilots. Results show that passive BCI can distinguish between alerts that are processed by the pilot as task-relevant or irrelevant in the cockpit based on the recorded EEG. The neuroadaptive model’s integration of this data resulted in significantly higher performance of 87\% overall accuracy in representing individual pilots’ responses to alerts and messages compared to 72\% accuracy of a normative model that did not consider EEG data. We conclude that neuroadaptive technology allows for implicit measurement and tracing of pilots’ perception and processing of alerts on the flight deck. Careful handling of uncertainties inherent to passive BCI and cognitive modeling shows how the representation of pilot cognitive states can be improved iteratively for providing assistance.},

Task knowledge and mental simulation allow for anticipating other agents' actions and for making inferences about their underlying mental representations. In human–AI teams, providing AI agents with anticipatory mechanisms can facilitate collaboration and successful execution of joint action. This paper presents a computational cognitive model demonstrating mental simulation of operators' mental models of a situation and anticipation of their behavior. The work proposes two successive steps: (1) A hierarchical cluster algorithm is applied to recognize patterns of behavior among pilots. These behavioral clusters are used to derive commonalities in situation models from empirical data (N = 13 pilots). (2) An ACT-R (adaptive control of thought - rational) cognitive model is implemented to mentally simulate different possible outcomes of action decisions and timing of a pilot. model tracing of ACT-R allows following up on operators' individual actions. Two models are implemented using the symbolic representations of ACT-R: one simulating normative behavior and the other by simulating individual differences and using subsymbolic learning. Model performance is analyzed by a comparison of both models. Results indicate the improved performance of the individual differences over the normative model and are discussed regarding implications for cognitive assistance capable of anticipating operator behavior.},

These mental models enable the anticipation of the behavior of individual users. The model is applied to a use case of automation surprise in commercial aviation to test how anticipation can best be modeled for cockpit applications. Empirical data from a flight simulator study including behavioral, neurophysiological and eye-tracking measures from 13 pilots were used to evaluate the model.

This model serves as a tool to predict attentional measurements with each task of a complete list of piloting actions. The main objective of this Attentional Task Model is to provide attention scores for all flight tasks allowing a classification of tasks on their attention scores. In order to determine these scores, we conducted several meetings and finally we held a focus group discussion with a group of pilots. Participants included pilots from CAE and Bombardier. Each participant has unique piloting experience and knowledge, and this variety made the discussion detailed and in-depth, and led to gathering information about the subject taking into account all aspects. The results of our analysis show that while the attentional score for all phases is fluctuating between 1 to 6, the “Rejected Takeoff” and “Go Around” are the most strategic phases and have highest Attention Scores (9 and 10 respectively). The aims of this discussion were to gather some information about the required amount of attention for flight phases from the beginning to the end of the flight. This information is very important to model the pilots’ attention and determine a baseline level of workload and required task attention.},

But because there is no uniform framework for expressing the content and structure of a human performance model, it is difficult to understand what is at stake in the implementation of a given model and all but impossible to compare and contrast different models despite the proliferation of quantitative modeling tools. The inability to communicate model structure and content is not just a practical shortcoming: it is a major impediment to assessing the validity, plausibility, and extensibility of human performance models. The latter aspect is particularly important as it prevents the incremental construction of large human performance models along standard software engineering practices. The goal of this panel discussion is to review past and ongoing efforts to develop general languages that specify cognitive models at a functional level of description. We do not expect a standard to emerge from this discussion, but rather we hope to canvass both the theoretical and practical issues that confront any attempt to develop a uniform language that describes different modeling frameworks.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence is developing at a rapid pace, with examples of machine learning already being used in aviation to improve efficiency. In the coming decade, it is likely that intelligent assistants (IAs) will be deployed to assist aviation personnel in the cockpit, the air traffic control center, and in airports. This will be a game-changer and may herald the way forward for single-pilot operations and AI-based air traffic management. Yet in aviation there is a core underlying tenet that 'people create safety' and keep the skies and passengers safe, based on a robust industry-wide safety culture. Introducing IAs into aviation might therefore undermine aviation's hard-won track record in this area. Three experts in safety culture and human-AI teaming used a validated safety culture tool to explore the potential impacts of introducing IAs into aviation. The results suggest that there are indeed potential negative outcomes, but also possible safety affordances wherein AI could strengthen safety culture. Safeguards and mitigations are suggested for the key risk owners in aviation organizations, from CEOs to middle managers, to safety departments and frontline staff. Such safeguards will help ensure safety remains a priority across the industry.},

We created three stages of task demand that were performed sequentially (Low-High-Low) during AF-MATB tasks and identified differences in neural connectivity during workload transition. We used NASA-TLX, and ISA to measure the subjective mental workload that accompanies the hysteresis effect in the task demand transitions. We found significant hysteresis effects on performance and various brain network measures such as outflow of prefrontal cortex and connectivity magnitude. These findings would allow us to clarify the direction and strength of the Granger Causality under demand transitions. Therefore, these results involving the neural mechanisms of hysteresis effects in multitasking environments may be utilized in applications of neuroergonomics research. Furthermore the ability to compare data derived from human participants to data gathered by the ACT-R model allows researchers to better account for hysteresis effects in neuro-cognitive models in the future.},

	abstract = {To ensure safe and efficient operation, operators in process industries have to make timely decisions based on time-varying information. A holistic assessment of operators’ performance is, therefore, challenging. Current approaches to operator performance assessment are subjective and ignore operators’ cognitive behavior. In addition, these cannot be used to predict operators’ expected responses during novel situations that may arise during plant operations. The present study seeks to develop a human digital twin (HDT) that can simulate a control room operator’s behavior, even during various abnormal situations. The HDT has been developed using the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought- Rational) cognitive architecture. It mimics a human operator as they monitor the process and intervene during abnormal situations. We conducted 426 trials to test the HDT's ability to handle disturbance rejection tasks. In these simulations, we varied the reward and penalty parameters to provide feedback to the HDT. We validated the HDT using the eye gaze behavior of eleven human subjects who completed 110 similar disturbance rejection tasks as that of the HDT. The results indicate that the HDT exhibits similar gaze behaviors as the human subjects, even when dealing with abnormal situations. These indicate that the HDT’s cognitive capabilities are comparable to those of human operators. As possible applications, the proposed HDT can be used to generate a large database of human behavior during abnormalities which can then be used to spot and rectify flaws in novice operator’s mental models. Additionally, the HDT can also enhance operators’ decision-making during real-time operation.},

	abstract = {Cognitive architectures such as ACT-R can be used to get a better understanding of the underlying processes in human cognition, but they can be hard to evaluate based on behavioral measures alone. Therefore, neural data can be used as additional information to inform models. There is a good connection between ACT-R and fMRI, but the connection between EEG is a lot less elaborated. EEG can be especially useful to get a better understanding of fast paced tasks because of the excellent temporal resolution of EEG. In this project we examined whether EEG could be used to constrain cognitive models. This is examined by evaluating the results from a model-based EEG analysis of an algebra solving task. Model-based analysis is a method to investigate new connections between model constructs and brain areas or to evaluate existing mappings between model constructs and brain areas. Model-based analysis uses the predictions from a cognitive model as regressors in a general linear model to examine the connections between EEG data and the model constructs. The model-based EEG analysis in this project showed promising results; the visual ACT-R module showed correlation between EEG data channels around the fusiform gyrus in the occipital lobe and the manual ACT-R module showed correlations between EEG channels around the motor cortex. These results show the connections between EEG data and model constructs and suggests that EEG data could be used to constrain cognitive models. However, the imaginal and declarative ACT-R modules did not show correlations between the module predictions and the EEG data channels around areas where we expected them. Therefore we suggest that our cognitive model of the algebra task needs refinement.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study investigated the use of human performance modeling (HPM) approach for prediction of driver behavior and interactions with in-vehicle technology.
Background
HPM has been applied in numerous human factors domains such as surface transportation as it can quantify and predict human performance; however, there has been no integrated literature review for predicting driver behavior and interactions with in-vehicle technology in terms of the characteristics of methods used and variables explored.
Method
A systematic literature review was conducted using Compendex, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. As a result, 100 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed by the authors. Model characteristics and variables were summarized to identify the research gaps and to provide a lookup table to select an appropriate method.
Results
The findings provided information on how to select an appropriate HPM based on a combination of independent and dependent variables. The review also summarized the characteristics, limitations, applications, modeling tools, and theoretical bases of the major HPMs.
Conclusion
The study provided a summary of state-of-the-art on the use of HPM to model driver behavior and use of in-vehicle technology. We provided a table that can assist researchers to find an appropriate modeling approach based on the study independent and dependent variables.
Application
The findings of this study can facilitate the use of HPM in surface transportation and reduce the learning time for researchers especially those with limited modeling background.},

We review the current state-of-the-art in team cognition research, but more importantly describe the limitations of existing theories, laboratory paradigms, and measures considering the increasing complexities of modern teams and the study of team cognition.
Background
Research on, and applications of, team cognition has led to theories, data, and measures over the last several decades.
Method
This article is based on research questions generated in a spring 2022 seminar on team cognition at Arizona State University led by the first author.
Results
Future research directions are proposed for extending the conceptualization of teams and team cognition by examining dimensions of teamness; extending laboratory paradigms to attain more realistic teaming, including nonhuman teammates; and advancing measures of team cognition in a direction such that data can be collected unobtrusively, in real time, and automatically.
Conclusion
The future of team cognition is one of the new discoveries, new research paradigms, and new measures.

Secondly, I comment on the innovative taxonomy of automation failure presented by Skraaning and Jamieson (2024), pointing out some issues with overlapping definitions and lack of cause-effect relationships. I then discuss the substantial opportunity this taxonomy presents to guide future research, such as the design of transparent automation. To conclude, I identify some other key problems regarding how we currently study human-automation teaming (e.g. presenting randomized automation failure unlinked to task context) and invite discussion from the research community on the relevance of computational modelling to this field of research.},

The paper presented a taxonomy of automation failure. The analysis and taxonomy demonstrate the integration of approaches to grasping automation failures from system instrumentation and controls, human factors engineering, and human reliability analysis. We reviewed the regulatory framework related to use of automation in nuclear power plants and examined whether the framework elements adequately address “Failure to Grasp Automation Failure” using the taxonomy in the target paper.

This paper reviews pilot decision-making when faced with a dual engine failure on take-off using three different decision models; the Recognition Primed Decision Model, Decision Ladders and the Perceptual Cycle Model. In-depth interviews with eight experienced airline pilots were conducted to capture their decision-making processes in response to a dual engine failure on take-off event. The analysis of these interviews using the three different decision models provide recommendations for a proposed decision assistant. The different decision models are discussed in relation to the insight they can bring to developing a future decision assistant tool within the flight deck of commercial aircraft.},

	abstract = {Due to the requirements of automatic system design, and new needs for the training of complex tasks, Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) has been used with increasing frequency in recent years by the airline industry and air traffic control community.  Its power is reflected in the literature on professional training and systems design, where CTA is often cited as one of the most promising new technologies, especially for the complex cognitive tasks now confronting those working in aviation.  The objective of this book is to bridge the gap between research and practice, to make what we know about CTA available to practitioners in the field.  The book focuses on cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence analyses of aviation tasks.  It is designed to help readers identify and solve specific design and training problems, in the flight deck, air traffic control and operations contexts. Distilling experience and guidelines from the best aviation cognitive analyses in accessible form, it is the first comprehensive volume on CTA, and is written for practitioners of cognitive analysis in aviation.  It provides an overview of analyses to date; methods of data collection; and recommendations for designing and conducting CTA for use in instructional design, systems development, and evaluation.  The first part of the book provides the principles and foundations of CTA, describing traditional approaches to task analysis and ways that cognitive analyses can be integrated with the analysis and development processes.  The next part details how to: select the appropriate method or methods; determine job tasks that can be trained for automatic performance; extract knowledge structures; analyse mental models; and identify the decision-making and problem-solving strategies associated with experienced job performance.  The authors also describe when to use and how to design and conduct a cognitive task analysis; how to use CTA along with traditional task analysis and ISD; and how to use CTA in training program development and systems design, as well as in personnel selection and evaluation. The current demand for cognitive analyses makes this a timely volume for those in aviation and, more generally, the industrial development and training communities.  Readers will find this a thorough presentation of cognitive analyses in aviation and a highly usable guide in the design, implementation and interpretation of CTA.  The book will be useful to instructional developers, aviation equipment and systems designers, researchers, government regulatory personnel, human resource managers, instructors, pilots, air traffic controllers, and operations staff.},

Observations of the problems encountered by the model in flying the simulator suggested a number of interventions that might mitigate error in the cockpit. Two of these interventions were selected for empirical testing. First, model runs and eye track data both suggested that the pilots/model were often unaware of changes in automation mode that were driven by the software rather than the pilot (i.e., uncommanded mode changes).

In the first component, subsymbolic information, acquired during navigation, aids in the retrieval of declarative information representing possible paths to take. In the second component, visual information directs the search, which in turn creates knowledge for the first component. The model is implemented using the ACT-R cognitive architecture and makes realistic assumptions about memory access and shifts in visual attention. We present simulation results for memory-based high-level navigation in grid and tree structures, and visual navigation in mazes, varying relevant cognitive (retrieval noise and visual finsts) and environmental (maze and path size) parameters. The visual component is evaluated with data from a multi-robot control experiment, where subjects planned paths for robots to explore a building. We describe a method to compare trajectories without referring to aligned points in the itinerary. The evaluation shows that the model provides a good fit, but also that planning strategies may vary with task loads.},

	abstract = {A baseline description of a cognitive model that has been successfully implemented on high-speed, low-altitude navigation fighter plane missions illustrates designs for an intelligent assistance system for future French combat aircraft. The outcomes are based on several empirical studies. Task complexity (risk, uncertainty, time pressure) is extreme and provides a prototypical example of a rapid process control situation which requires specific assistance problems. The paper is divided into three sections: 1.1. A general review discusses implications of the specific requirements for coupling an intelligent assistance system to pilots. Special attention is paid to understanding and coherence of the aid, both of which directly influence the nature of the system.2.2. An empirical analysis of missions carried out by novice and experienced pilots forms the basis for a cognitive model of in-flight navigation problem solving. Because of time pressure and risk, pilots have as much difficulty applying solutions as diagnosing problems. Pilots tend to develop a sophisticated model of the situation in order to anticipate problems and actively avoid or minimize problem difficulty. In contrast, poor solutions tend to be found for unexpected problems and generally result in renunciation of the mission and/or crash.3.3. The cognitive model described above serves as the basis for a computer cognitive model for flying high-speed, low-altitude navigation missions. The model splits functional knowledge into two levels: the local level deals with sub-goals and short-term activities; the global level deals with mission objectives and handles medium- and long-term activities. A resource manager coordinates the two levels. The program uses an Al actor programming style. This computer cognitive model serves to develop an intelligent navigation assistance system which can function as an automaton or as a tactical support system.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the PRODEC scenario-based design method is the incremental cross-fertilization and refinement of procedural scenarios and declarative configurations. It uses virtual prototypes of the developed systems (mainly life-critical systems) to conduct human-in-the-loop simulations (HITLSs). Based on human systems integration (HSI) principles and criteria, as well as expertise and experience in the domain at stake, this HSI approach grounded in virtual environments requires a clear definition of physical and cognitive tangibility metrics to assess the distance between virtual and tangible (grasp) dimensions of the system being developed when it is put to work. PRODEC considers human and machine systems described in terms of structures and functions incrementally designed using procedural scenarios (i.e., stories) in task and activity networks, which provide life to declarative configurations (i.e., system's functions and structures). This active modeling and simulation process enables the discovery of emergent structures and functions of the system being developed when it is virtually operated. PRODEC's use is illustrated in an example. We discuss the use of PRODEC and its results as to how they can be used with digital twins.},

While multi-agent systems are traditionally deployed in controlled and structured environments that allow for controlled testing (e.g., warehouses), the SubT challenge targeted various types of unknown underground environments that imposed the risk of robot loss in the case of failure. In this work, we introduce a video game-inspired interface, an autonomous mission assistant, and test and deploy these using a heterogeneous multi-agent system in challenging environments.

Traditional approaches for the evaluation of the re-designed procedures and training, such as expert reviews and human-in-the-loop tests, cannot provide comprehensive analysis, cannot be performed until after the procedures and training are developed, and are cost and time prohibitive. This paper describes the emergence of a new class of tools to automate the evaluation of procedures and training. The tools capture the procedures and tasks to be trained in a formal model that is stored in a data-base. Human performance models are executed to estimate the ease-of-learning, ease-of-use and likelihood of failure of each of the tasks. The procedures and tasks can be defined rapidly, and modified and run repeatedly throughout the development cycle. The underlying models and tools are described in this paper. A case study and the implications of these tools are also discussed.},

	abstract = {According to a previously built situation-awareness (SA) model based on attention allocation, with the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought, Rational) theory for analyzing pilot cognitive processes for situation elements, an SA mathematical model was improved to predict pilot SA during exposure to different display interfaces and missions. An indicator-display monitoring task was performed under different experimental conditions for SA model verification, while the SA global assessment technique (SAGAT), performance measures, 10-dimensional SA rating technique (10-D SART), and eye movement measures were adopted to comprehensively assess the operator's SA. The experimental results revealed that theoretical prediction values calculated using the improved SA model were strongly correlated with the operation performance, and thus confirming the model validation. The SAGAT was shown to be a more effective method than SART in this research, and the overall SAGAT accuracy rate, as well as the accuracy response time, are effective indices for SA measurement. Eye-movement indices, such as the fixation/saccade ratio, which corresponds to the mode of information perception and extraction, was examined to be sensitive to operator's SA changes. The Advances of the improved SA model have been achieved in predicting and indicating SA by using human behaviors, including operation performance, SAGAT response behaviors, and visual behaviors. Thereby, it provides a new auxiliary tool for quantitative characterization of pilot's SA during cockpit interface design optimization and ergonomic evaluation.},

G2A allows ACT-R models to be built much more quickly, in hours rather than weeks. Because GOMS is a more abstract formalism than ACT-R, most GOMS operators can be plausibly translated in different ways into ACT-R productions (e.g., a GOMS Look-for operator can be carried out by different visual search strategies in ACT-R). Given a GOMS model, G2A generates and evaluates alternative ACT-R models by systematically varying the mapping of GOMS operators to ACT-R productions. In experiments with a text editing task, G2A produces ACT-R models whose predictions are within 5\% of GOMS model predictions. In the same domain, G2A also generates ACT-R models that give better predictions than GOMS, providing good predictions of overall task duration for actual users (within 2\%), though the models are less accurate at a detailed level. In a separate experiment with a mouse-driven telephone dialing task, G2A produces models that do a better job of distinguishing between competing interfaces than a Fitts’ law model or an ACT-R model built by hand. G2A starts to describe the relationship between two major theories of cognition. This may have appeared a simple relationship, but the complexity of the translation illustrates why this was not done before. G2A shows a way forward for cognitive models, that of higher level languages that compile into more detailed specifications.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence of sensitivity, predictiveness, and methodological concerns regarding direct, objective measures of situation awareness (SA).
BACKGROUND: The ability to objectively measure SA is important to the evaluation of user interfaces and displays, training programs, and automation initiatives, as well as for studies that seek to better understand SA in both individuals and teams. A number of methodological criticisms have been raised creating significant confusion in the research field.
METHOD: A meta-analysis of 243 studies was conducted to examine evidence of sensitivity and predictiveness, and to address methodological questions regarding Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), Situation Present Assessment Technique (SPAM), and their variants.
RESULTS: SAGAT and SPAM were found to be equally predictive of performance. SPAM (64\%) and real-time probes (73\%) were found to have significantly lower sensitivity in comparison to SAGAT (94\%). While SAGAT was found not to be overly memory reliant nor intrusive into operator performance, SPAM resulted in problems with intrusiveness in 40\% of the studies examined, as well as problems with speed-accuracy tradeoffs, sampling bias, and confounds with workload. Concerns about memory reliance, the utility of these measures for assessing Team SA, and other issues are also addressed.
CONCLUSION: SAGAT was found to be a highly sensitive, reliable, and predictive measure of SA that is useful across a wide variety of domains and experimental settings.
APPLICATION: Direct, objective SA measurement provides useful and diagnostic insights for research and design in a wide variety of domains and study objectives.},

Although effective performance has been typically associated with higher situational awareness, some studies did not find this trend. This study examined some of the factors that could influence that relationship. Using a firefighting simulator, we asked participants to run through four urban firefighting scenarios, two as individual players and the other two as two-person teams. The findings show better performance in teams as compared to individuals. In contrast, individuals had higher levels of SA when they played alone compared to playing in a team. In other words, even though the team performed better, it was not associated with team members having better situational awareness in the team scenarios. It is possible that team processes, such as communication and coordination, were not effective in the team play in the experiment, resulting in poorer SA, yet not disruptive enough to the performance. This was probably because they could have reached high performance without effective teamwork. There may also be some tacit situational knowledge not measured by SAGAT, that mediates situational awareness and performance.},

Traditionally, GDTA and mCWA have been applied to narrowly focused physical-based domains; however, the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) incident response domain is a very complex domain in which individual humans and teams of humans with specialised skills and responsibilities are considered to be system components. The resulting system combines very large number of components, decision-makers and uncertain environmental issues. Each analysis technique provided strengths that complemented the other's weaknesses; however, the analysis techniques required augmentations in order to facilitate information capture and correspondence to design requirements. The contributions of this article include a presentation of the augmentations and a discussion of the benefits provided by employing both analysis techniques.},

The approach is motivated by the desire for robots to perform less like teleoperated tools or independent automatons and more like interdependent teammates. In this article, we describe what it means to be interdependent, why this is important, and the design implications that follow from this perspective. We argue for a human-robot system model that supports interdependence through careful attention to requirements for observability, predictability, and directability. We present a Coactive Design method and show how it can be a useful approach for developers trying to understand how to translate high-level teamwork concepts into reusable control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors that enable robots to fulfill their envisioned role as teammates. As an example of the coactive design approach, we present our results from the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge, a competition designed to spur development of advanced robots that can assist humans in recovering from natural and man-made disasters. Twenty-six teams from eight countries competed in three different tasks providing an excellent evaluation of the relative effectiveness of different approaches to human-machine system design.},

	abstract = {The Unmanned Tactical Autonomous Control and Collaboration (UTACC) program is a Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) initiative to build a Marine-robotic collaborative infantry fire team. The impact of robotic teammates on the situation awareness (SA) of the fire team is a central concern for this program. The proliferation of SA enhancing technology to the lowest echelons of Marine infantry forces often involves a tradeoff between focused and distributed SA due to limited attention resources. UTACC seeks a means to measure SA tradeoffs due to the incorporation of robots into infantry fire teams. This thesis reviews present models of individual and team SA that are applicable to the military infantry environment and proposes individual and team models of SA that address the unique requirements of UTACC. The authors then applied SA principles to Coactive Design in order to inform robotic design. The result is a methodology framework using interdependence analysis (IA) tables for informing design requirements based on SA requirements. Future research should seek to develop additional IA tables for the entirety of the Marine Corps infantry fire team mission set.},

Icons, a common component of graphical user interfaces, serve as the focus for a set of studies aimed at (1) developing a detailed understanding of how people search for an icon in a typically crowded screen of other icons that vary in similarity to the target, and (2) building a cognitively plausible model that simulates the processes inferred in the human search process. An eye-tracking study of the task showed that participants rarely refixated icons that they had pre-viously examined, and that participants used an efficient search strategy of exam-ining distractor icons nearest to their current point of gaze. These findings were integrated into an ACT-R model of the task using EMMA and a "nearest" strat-egy. The model fit the response time data of participants as well as a previous model of the task, but was a much better fit to the eye movement data.

Bainbridge's paper displays influences of several researchers, but Rasmussen's work on operator performance in process systems has perhaps been most influential. Unlike those who had earlier considered operator input a unidimensional aspect of system performance to be considered equally with other system elements, Rasmussen viewed operator performance as multidimensional-to be considered, with training and experience, in examining the operator role in system operations. Expanding on his work and applying it to automated systems, Bainbridge described how automation fundamentally altered the role of the human operator in system performance. Requiring the operator to oversee an automated system that could function more accurately and more reliably than he or she could, can affect system performance in the event that operator intervention is needed. The influence of the insights Bainbridge provided on the effects of automation on system performance could be seen in both research on automation and in the recognition of ironies discussed in subsequent automation-related accidents. Its inspiration to researchers, accident investigators, regulators, and managers continues to this day as automation development and its implementation continue unabated.},

The present research aims to investigate changes in trainees’ cognitive control levels during a pilot training process while they underwent basic flight maneuvers. EEG microstate analysis was applied together with spectral power features to quantitatively monitor trainees’ cognitive control under varied flight tasks during different training sessions on a flight simulator. Not only could EEG data provide an objective measure of cognitive control to complement the current subjective assessments, but the application of EEG microstate analysis is particularly well-suited for capturing rapid dynamic changes in cognitive states that may happen under complex human activities in conducting flight maneuvers. Comparisons were conducted between two types of tasks and across different training stages to monitor how pilot trainees’ cognitive control responds to varied flight task types and training stages. The present research provides insights into the changes in trainees’ cognitive control during a pilot training process and highlights the potential of EEG microstate analysis for monitoring cognitive control.},

	abstract = {Aviation safety depends on the skill and expertise of pilots to meet the task demands of flying an aircraft in an effective and efficient manner. During flight training, students may respond differently to imposed task demands based on individual differences in capacity, physiological arousal, and effort. To ensure that pilots achieve a common desired level of expertise, training programs should account for individual differences to optimize pilot performance. This study investigates the relationship between task performance and physiological correlates of effort in ab initio pilots. Twenty-four participants conducted a flight simulator task with three difficulty levels and were asked to rate their perceived demand and effort using the NASA TLX. We recorded heart rate, EEG brain activity, and pupil size to assess changes in the participants’ mental and physiological states across different task demands. We found that, despite group-level correlations between performance error and physiological responses, individual differences in physiological responses to task demands reflected different levels of participant effort and task efficiency. These findings suggest that physiological monitoring of student pilots might provide beneficial insights to flight instructors to optimize pilot training at the individual level.},

A better understanding of task-related emotions and flying performance is needed to enhance pilot training. Objective Understand pilot trainees' performance and emotional dynamics (intensity, frequency and variability) based on training phase and difficulty level in a flight simulator. Methods Twenty-three volunteers performed basic flight manoeuvres. Trials were divided into three phases: Introduction (trials 1–7), session A (trials 8–15) and session B (trials 16–22). Three task difficulty levels were implemented (low, medium and high). Flying performance was evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) and expert ratings. Emotional intensity was inferred from physiological (electrodermal activity) and behavioural (facial expressions) emotional responses. Emotional variability was calculated to understand fluctuations among multiple emotions. Emotional responses were mapped into task-relevant emotions, like sadness with boredom, and fear with anxiety. Results and Conclusions The most frequent facial expressions neutral, anger and surprise. Neutral and anger were interpreted as deep focus states. Surprise was likely a response to unexpected events. Flying performance and emotional dynamics varied across training phases and difficulty levels. During introduction, performance was less accurate, and emotions were less frequent. During session A, performance improved while participants experienced more physiological arousal and emotional variability. During session B, performance was the most accurate. In high-difficulty tasks, performance was the least accurate, participants expressed emotions with more frequency, more variability and higher physiological arousal. Future studies can use simulated flying tasks for trainees to familiarize with their emotional reactions to task demands expecting to improve training outcomes.},

All three dichotomies produced large, significant effects on event miss rate. A model of human attention and noticing, N-SEEV, was then used to predict event noticing performance as a function of event salience and expectancy, and retinal eccentricity. Eccentricity is predicted from steady state scanning by the SEEV model of attention allocation.

	abstract = {Objective: The objective is to validate a computational model of visual attention against empirical data—derived from a meta-analysis—of pilots’ failure to notice safety-critical unexpected events. Background: Many aircraft accidents have resulted, in part, because of failure to notice nonsalient unexpected events outside of foveal vision, illustrating the phenomenon of change blindness. A model of visual noticing, N-SEEV (noticing— salience, expectancy, effort, and value), was developed to predict these failures. Method: First, 25 studies that reported objective data on miss rate for unexpected events in high-fidelity cockpit simulations were identified, and their miss rate data pooled across five variables (phase of flight, event expectancy, event location, presence of a head-up display, and presence of a highway-in-the-sky display). Second, the parameters of the N-SEEV model were tailored to mimic these dichotomies. Results: The N-SEEV model output predicted variance in the obtained miss rate (r = .73). The individual miss rates of all six dichotomous conditions were predicted within 14\%, and four of these were predicted within 7\%. Conclusion: The N-SEEV model, developed on the basis of an independent data set, was able to successfully predict variance in this safety-critical measure of pilot response to abnormal circumstances, as collected from the literature. Applications: As new technology and procedures are envisioned for the future airspace, it is important to predict if these may compromise safety in terms of pilots’ failing to notice unexpected events. Computational models such as N-SEEV support cost-effective means of making such predictions.},

These are combined additively, and accurately predict visual scanning on the flight deck and in driving.

Accordingly, pilots’ attention allocation is strongly related to their task performance. This study is aimed at analyzing pilots’ fixation characteristics and attention-allocation levels. First, we proposed a model for measuring attention-allocation level based on the salience, effort, expectancy, and value (SEEV) model. Second, a low-fidelity single-pilot operation (SPO) cockpit environment was constructed, and 20 pilots were recruited for an experiment to compare their fixation characteristics between SPO and double-pilot operation (DPO) scenarios. The results showed slight differences in the attention levels allocated by SPO and DPO pilots under a scenario of one-engine failure. It concluded that Human-centered flight deck design can enhance a pilot’s attention allocation level. These findings can be used to optimize future flight deck designing and flight training for improving pilot’s task performance.},

	abstract = {Researchers and developers are pursuing increasingly sophisticated roles for autonomous systems. Whether working within networked systems as software agents or embedded in robots and unmanned vehicles, what makes these systems valuable is their intelligent, active, and adaptive nature. These qualities are often characterized in intelligent systems literature by the word "autonomy"-a catch-all label that highlights the qualities of self-directedness and self-sufficiency in task performance. Though continuing research to make machines more active, adaptive, and functional is essential, the point of increasing such proficiencies is not merely to make the machines more independent during times when unsupervised activity is desirable or necessary, but also to make them more capable of sophisticated interdependent joint activity with people and other machines when such is required. That means autonomous systems must support not only fluid orchestration of task handoffs among different people and machines, but also combined participation on shared tasks requiring continuous and close interaction. HART research seeks to bring together the best thinking from diverse research communities in order to advance current and anticipated applications of intelligent human-machine collaboration, including the participation of humans as first-class citizens in collaboration with autonomous systems. This would enable autonomous systems not merely to do things for people, but also to work together with people and other systems-the inevitable next leap-forward required in autonomous system design and deployment.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pilot instrument monitoring has been described as “inadequate,” “ineffective,” and “insufficient” after multicrew aircraft accidents. Regulators have called for improved instrument monitoring by flight crews, but scientific knowledge
in the area is scarce. Research has tended to investigate the monitoring of individual pilots when in the pilot-flying role; very little research has looked at crew monitoring, or that of the “monitoring-pilot” role despite it being half of the apparent problem.
METHODS:
Eye-tracking data were collected from 17 properly constituted and current Boeing 737 crews operating in a full motion simulator. Each crew flew four realistic flight segments, with pilots swapping between the pilot-flying and pilot-monitoring roles, with and without the autopilot engaged.
Analysis was performed on the 375 maneuvering-segments prior to localizer intercept.
RESULTS: Autopilot engagement led to significantly less visual dwell time on the attitude director indicator (mean 212.8–47.8 s for the flying pilot and 58.5–39.8 s for the monitoring-pilot)
and an associated increase on the horizontal situation indicator (18–52.5 s and 36.4–50.5 s).
DISCUSSION: The flying-pilots’ withdrawal of attention from the primary flight reference and increased attention to the primary navigational reference was paralleled rather
than complemented by the monitoring-pilot, suggesting that monitoring vulnerabilities can be duplicated in the flight deck. Therefore it is possible that accident causes identified as “inadequate” or “insufficient” monitoring, are in fact a result of parallel monitoring.Jarvis

Here, we review the literature on the correlation between trust and dependence. On average, this correlation across people was quite low, suggesting that people who are more trusting of automation do not necessarily depend upon it more. Separately, we examined experiments that explicitly manipulated the reliability of automation, finding that higher automation reliability increased trust ratings twice as fast as dependence behaviours. This review provides novel quantitative evidence that the two constructs are not strongly correlated. Implications of this work, including potential moderating variables, contexts where trust is still relevant, and considerations of trust measurement, are discussed. Trust in automation is a cognitive attitude, and dependence on automation is a physical behaviour. Therefore, it is important to understand the differences between the two, especially as they have been conflated in the literature. This review highlights the small average correlation in the literature between subjective trust and objective dependence, which suggests that measuring trust as dependence (or vice versa) may not be valid. This suggests, then, that practitioners should carefully consider how trust and dependence are being measured in a given context so as not to incorrectly conflate the two.},

	abstract = {As automation becomes more sophisticated, the nature of its interaction with people will need to change in profound ways. Many approaches to designing more team-like cooperation between humans and machines have been proposed, including function allocation, supervisory control, adaptive automation, dynamic task allocation, adjustable autonomy, mixedinitiative interaction-most recently regrouped under the rubric of cooperative robotics. All these approaches rely on the concept of levels of autonomy as the benchmark for machine performance and the criterion for decisions about human-machine task allocation and the supervisory control regimen. This article argues that the levels of autonomy concept is incomplete and insufficient as a model for designing complex human-machine teams, largely because it does not sufficiently account for interdependence among their members. Building on a theory of joint activity, the authors introduce the notion of coactive design, an approach to human-machine interaction that takes interdependence as the central organizing principle among people and agents working together as a team.},

	abstract = {As machines' autonomy increases, the possibilities for collaboration between a human and a machine also increase. In particular, tasks may be performed with varying levels of interdependence, i.e. from independent to joint actions. The feasibility of each type of interdependence depends on factors that contribute to contextual trustworthiness, such as team members' competence, willingness and external factors. In this paper, we present the Interdependence and Trust Analysis (ITA) framework, which is an extension of Coactive Design's Interdependence Analysis framework (Johnson, M. et al. 2014. Coactive Design: Designing Support for Interdependence in Joint Activity. Journal of Human-Robot Interaction 3 (1): 43-69. https://doi.org/10.5898/JHRI.3.1.Johnson). By including information on contextual trustworthiness, ITA can better support the design of human-machine teams, as well as task allocation and selection. Evaluated through expert interviews and a focus group involving a search and rescue scenario, ITA shows potential as a decision-making tool and a communication bridge among human and machine teammates. Our findings emphasise the need to define tasks and roles based on agent characteristics, and imply that decision-making models should align with human-centred objectives. ITA also highlights the trade-off between utility and effort when designing trustworthy systems, suggesting that guided conversations could improve the team design process. Finally, the ITA framework may improve transparency, justification, and interpretability in decision-making, contributing to appropriate trust among teammates.},

	abstract = {Situation awareness (SA) is the ability to perceive, comprehend and project environmental information. Neural activity is closely associated with SA. However, it remains unclear how neural activity represents SA at different levels. Here, three tasks were used to assess SA at three levels, behavioural and electroencephalogram data were collected. Relationships between SA and neural activity were explored through comparisons of EEG power between high and low SA. For each SA level, EEG power significantly differed between high and low SA. Brain region-based analyses further revealed neural activities originating from distinct brain regions were recruited to represent SA at different levels. These EEG pattern features differed between high and low SA could be used to decode SA with the KNN (k-nearest neighbour) classifier. The present study marked a significant step in augmenting our understanding of the neural mechanism that characterise SA. This study explores how neural activity represents situation awareness at perception, comprehension, and projection levels using 64-channel EEG data from 28 participants. Significant EEG power differences and regional neural activities were identified, and KNN successfully decoded SA. Findings enhance understanding of neural mechanisms in SA processing.},
